    "- What is the defenition of iteration in your own words\n",
    "     - Iteration is the process of simplifying/making code more efficient by allowing for loops and repeating steps\n",
    "- Explain how the game relates to itertation\n",
    "     - The game uses iteration to move the robot to a certain position with only a few lines of instruction that repeat.\n",
    "- What parts of the code use iteration (game example)\n",
    "     - The game utilizes iteration multiple times. Any level that involves a loop, uses iteration. Leves 2 through 5 have iteration. In your backend code for the game, many for loops are used to have a condition for every possiblility of the user's action/movement.\n",
    "- Explain which parts of the code use lists\n",
    "     - The backend code for the game uses a movement list that stores the user's input. The list allows the code to iterate through it with a series of for loops.\n",
    "- Explain what list manipulation is happening in that part\n",
    "     - The list has movements getting appended to it, and is analyzed and indexed. "
