    "\n",
    "1. What is the purpose of \"sudo\" when running commands in terminal?\n",
    "    - \"Sudo\" overrides any issue needing permmision in the terminal. So, if I need to do a command that requires a higher-permmision than the root-user, I would put \"sudo\" in front of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are some commands which allow us to look at how the storage of a machine is set up as?\n",
    "    - Some command whoch allow us to look at how the storage of a machine is set up as are \"dir\", \"diskpart\", \"wmic logicaldisk get\" and \"diskmgmt.msc\" (on windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What do you think are some alternatives to running \"curl -O\" to get the zip file for KASM?\n",
    "    - Some alternatives to running \"curl -O\" are to manually download the sip file using \"wget\" or to download and transfer it through something like Google-Drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What kind of commands do you think the \"install.sh\" command has and why is it necessary to call it?\n",
    "    - Checking for system requirements\n",
    "    - Downloading necessary files\n",
    "    - Setting up environment\n",
    "    - Installing necessary packages or libraries\n",
    "    - \"install.sh\" is called to make the the installation process easier and more likely to be sucessful.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain in at least 3-4 sentences how deploying KASM is related to/requires other topics talked about in the lesson and/or potential ways to add things mentioned in the lesson to this guide.\n",
    "    - Deploying KASM, the container-based streaming service, requires several components such as headers, NGINX, load balancing, configuration, DNS, and CORS. Headers are important for configuring security settings and enabling CORS for KASM. NGINX is used as a reverse proxy to handle incoming web traffic and load balancing is necessary for distributing the traffic among multiple server instances running KASM. Configuration is required to set up the KASM service and define the specific settings for the environment in which it will run. DNS is used to map the KASM domain name to its IP address, so users can access the service through a web browser. Overall, deploying KASM requires a comprehensive understanding of the technologies involved, including headers, NGINX, load balancing, configuration, DNS, and CORS. It is a complex process that requires careful planning and execution to ensure the service runs smoothly and securely.\n",
