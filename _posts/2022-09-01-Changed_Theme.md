# Changed my Theme to Cayman

### This is what it looked like when I changed the theme of my Fastpage in GitHub. It looked very nice with the new blue/green colors and fonts.

### However, some aspects in the Fastpage were limited. For example, the fonts became different sizes. The images from the posts on the home page were different sizes. Also, you are not able to acess the other pages (ex: My Work, About Me, Tags, etc.)

### Also, the presentation of the posts look different. The tags don't have the little symbol to the left of them like in the minima theme. Also, everything is spaced to the left.
