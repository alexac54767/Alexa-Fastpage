## Collaboration Importance
- Collaboration is essential in everyday life 
- Facebook (very successful tech company) says "Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it."
- To create the new and improved Super Mario Brothers, 2 partners listened to each other and used eachother's ideas to create an even better version
- interpersonal skills learned through collaboration: communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, negotiation

## How to Collborate in APCSP
- Pair programming (2 programmers): "the driver" writes program code while "the observer/pointer/navigator" reviews each line of program code as it is typed in
- Think-Pair-Share: students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, then share results with the class
- Leave comments in your code: communicate to your partner(s), communicate to yourself, acknowleedge code segments/media from other sources, differentiate what you and partner(s) did, clarify the functionality of your code

## Online tools
- repl.it (can work together)
- GitHub (collaboration and repository)
- Shared document or folder
- ask friends and family to test drive your program and give you feedback
