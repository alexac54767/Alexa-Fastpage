## Computing Innovations (categories)
- Applications (games, social media, business, productivity)
- Physical Devices (computers, smartphones, tablets, Smart "things", wearables)
- Systems (E-commerce, cloud services, E-mail) not local machine

### essential questions: Why does the computing innovation exist? What problems does it solve?

## Inputs Types
- tactile
- audio
- visual
- text
### What types of inputs do your devices accept?
- Most programs are written in an event driven enviornment
- input usually affects the output (mouse clicks, mouse clicks, screen taps/swipes, physical button clicks, keyboard entries, audio trigger)
- outputs produced by device (visual, audio, tactle, text)

### Action triggers an event
- action may be initiated by user/another program or device
- program "jumps" to code segment accoording to event
- code segment is executed
- output is triggered by code segment

## What is a program?
- program = collection of statements
- statement = a single command
- group of statements is called a code statement
- code segments are executed accoording to the rules of the programming lang
- a pragram is often reffered to as software

## Developing a Program
- developed with a specific purpose in mind
- developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan
- sometimes is more exploratory than anything

### How is a program developed?
- determine requirements of program
- understand the constraints
- understand the user concerns/intrests
- brianstorm
- storyboard program
- plan user experience
- lay out user interface
- organize into modules
- develop testing strategy
- make prototype
- test, test test (at all levels)
- reflect after testing

## Comments
- allows programmers to write text within program (without affecting program)
- comments are for programmers to read
- helpful in collabortation
- provide credit to those who deserve it in your program
- use comments to give credit for specific parts
- if you use someone else's code, give credit

## Program Documentation
- describe overall program
- list program specifications
- describe funtions/procedures/methods within code
- describe specific code segments
- describe the development of program
- how other programs may interact with program
- list of contributers/authors of program
