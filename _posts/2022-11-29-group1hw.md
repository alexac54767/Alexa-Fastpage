## Answer these:
- In your **own** words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is
    - An assignment operator asigns the value on the right of it (in this case =) to the variable on the left.
- In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables?
    - Collegeboard pseudocode uses the arrow, <--, to assign values to variables.
- A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22?
    - The command would display 22, since it has been updated and assigned the new value.
