## Hack 1
- sequencing: 
    - The sequencing in this algorithm provided is how it has the steps (1-5) that must be performed in order. To go onto step 2, you miust do step 1 first.
- Selection:
    - Selection is used in this algorithm when it decides what to do when it evaluates if the numer equals the item. If it does, it must decide to display "item foud". However, if it doesn't, then the algorithm decides to display "item not found".
- Iteration:
    - Iteration is used in this algorithm when it must cycle through the list, checking if the condition is met. Once it has gone through all of the number, it returns to step 2 to repeat.
