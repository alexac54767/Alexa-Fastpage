### Hack 1: 3.5
[] Explain in your own words what each logical operator does
[] Code your own scenario that makes sense for each logical operator


### Hack 3?

[x] For the first hack, pretend you are a school's test grader. Create an array with integers, each integer representing one score from a student's taken tests. If the average of the student's test scores are at least 75 percent, then display that the student is elligible for credit, and if not, display that the student must retake the tests over break. 
[x] The second hack is more number-oriented. Create an algorithm that calculates the sum of two numbers, then determines whether the sum is greater than or less than 100.
[] The hacks above was heavily derived from CollegeBoard. As a computer science student, you should be able to create an algorithm utilizing conditionals. Try something number-oriented if you get stuck. Creativity gets points.

## Hack 4
[] Create 3 differnt flow charts representing nested statements and transfer them into code.
[] Create a piece of code that displays four statements instead of three. Try to do more if you can.
[] Make piece of code that gives three different recommandations for possible classes to take at a scholl based on two different condtions. These conditions could be if the student likes STEM or not.

Kahoot quiz:

### Hack 2: 3.6
[x] Level I: Vowel Count
Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string. We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this challenge (but not y). The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

Hint: If you use a lot of if-statements and there are more than one outcome, that is to be expected. If not, don't panic, just keep trying.


[x] Level III: Mutliples of 3 or 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

Hint: What do you know about for loops? Since your code incorporates a list of numbers from 1 to the max number, can you use for loops along with conditionals?
