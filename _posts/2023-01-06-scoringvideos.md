## Submission #1

### My Score: 6/6

### Collegeboard Score: 4/6

### Reflection
- I was surprised to see the score that collegeboard gave this student. Looking through the written response, I believed that the project fit all the critera.
- Row 1 (Program Purpose and Function): The student didn't get the point for row 1 since they fit 5 of the 6 critera. Collegeboard believes that the student didn't describe the function's purpose (rather explained its functionality)
    - this was eye-opening, especially since the student response seemed alright to me, and like something I would possibly write. Now I realize that I need to be much more careful and detail oriented to ensure I am going to hit all 6 critera
- Row 3 (Managing Complexity): The student also didn't get the point for row 3 since he met <u>none</u> of the critera.
    - This score was shocking to me. This entire class I have seen lists as easier and usually always helpful. When I looked at this project, I believed that the list was very smart and effective. However, apparently it doesn't contribute to managing complexity. This was also a good warning to me that I need to make sure that my list is actually helping to manage complexity (not all lists are useful)


## Submission #2

### My Score: 5/6

### Collegeboard Score: 6/6

### Reflection
- Row 5 (Algorithm Implentation): I scored differently than college board on one the the critera here. I thought that the student didn't describe the code enough that one would be able to re-create it. However, that probably just reflects my current abilities in coding (especically compared to an expert working for collegeboard.)
- I believe that this student did a wonderful job. I really love how they put text boxes within the images of code to describe it as they went. It made it much more organized and easier to follow. 
- The student was also very thorough with all their explanations. It's good to keep in mind that quality really matters here (have more than you need)
