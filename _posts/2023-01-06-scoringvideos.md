# Performance Task Scoring 1

## Submission #1

### My Score: 6/6
[Link to my rubric](https://github.com/alexac54767/Alexa-Fastpage/issues/16)

### Collegeboard Score: 4/6

### Reflection
- I was surprised to see the score that collegeboard gave this student. Looking through the written response, I believed that the project fit all the critera.
- Row 1 (Program Purpose and Function): The student didn't get the point for row 1 since they fit 5 of the 6 critera. Collegeboard believes that the student didn't describe the function's purpose (rather explained its functionality)
    - this was eye-opening, especially since the student response seemed alright to me, and like something I would possibly write. Now I realize that I need to be much more careful and detail oriented to ensure I am going to hit all 6 critera
- Row 3 (Managing Complexity): The student also didn't get the point for row 3 since he met <u>none</u> of the critera.
    - This score was shocking to me. This entire class I have seen lists as easier and usually always helpful. When I looked at this project, I believed that the list was very smart and effective. However, apparently it doesn't contribute to managing complexity. This was also a good warning to me that I need to make sure that my list is actually helping to manage complexity (not all lists are useful)


## Submission #2

### My Score: 5/6

### Collegeboard Score: 6/6

### Reflection
- Row 5 (Algorithm Implentation): I scored differently than college board on one the the critera here. I thought that the student didn't describe the code enough that one would be able to re-create it. However, that probably just reflects my current abilities in coding (especically compared to an expert working for collegeboard.)
- I believe that this student did a wonderful job. I really love how they put text boxes within the images of code to describe it as they went. It made it much more organized and easier to follow. 
- The student was also very thorough with all their explanations. It's good to keep in mind that quality really matters here (have more than you need)

# Performance Task Scoring 2

## Submission #1

### My Score: 3/6
[Link to my rubric](https://github.com/alexac54767/Alexa-Fastpage/issues/18)

### Collegeboard Score: 1/6
[Link to their rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HXDauimq8edpT0-aZ2iIujzLdIxtyKMx/view)

### Reflection
- Row 1 (Program Purpose and Function): Both Collogeboard and I gave a 0 for this section. 
    - The student incorrectly identifies the input and output, and descrived the functionality as the purpose. Thier given purpose was incorrect.
- Row 2 (Data Abstraction): The student recieved a 0 on this section from Collegeboard, but I gave it a 1.
    - They did have images of lists and identified a name, however, the name did not correleate to the images provided.
    - When I do my project, I need to make sure I spend careful attention to details, and make sure every description matches my images.
- Row 3 (Managing Complexity): Both Collogeboard and I gave a 0 for this section.
    - The images did not show a list being used, and the code was not complex.
    - the sudent did not explain how the list manages complexity
    - I need to make sure that my project will have a list that actually manges complexity and is useful
- Row 4 (Procedural Abstraction): The student recieved a 0 on this section from Collegeboard, but I gave it a 1.
    - the response does not describe how this procedure contributes to the overall functionality
- Row 5 (Algorithm Implentation): Both Collogeboard and I gave a 0 for this section.
    - the description of the program was brief and doesn't allow for someone to recreate it
- What I've learned with this project and scoring is that I will need to follow the directions completely when I do my project.


## Submission #4

### My Score: 6/6
[Link to my rubric](https://github.com/alexac54767/Alexa-Fastpage/issues/19)

### Collegeboard Score: 3/6
[Link to their rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1so2WKNMi5vONuFCWZFFUqq8gVWNe_jCS/view)

### Reflection
-  Row 2 (Data Abstraction): The student recieved a 0 on this section from Collegeboard, but I gave it a 1.
    - data stored in the list is not being used in the second image
    - once again this shows how specific my images must be in order to recieve credit
- Row 3 (Managing Complexity): The student recieved a 0 on this section from Collegeboard, but I gave it a 1.
    - the list is not used to manage complexity (acts as a counter, so it can be replaced with a single counter variable)
    - like other examples, I need to make sure that my list is actually managing complexity and is useful
- Row 6 (Testing): The student recieved a 0 on this section from Collegeboard, but I gave it a 1.
    - The response gives the conditions being tested rather than two different arguments that cause a different segment of code to execute. Arguments should be specific values used in the call to the procedure.
    - this is the first time I've seen this score for section 6. I need to make sure to follow Collegeboard's critera for what an argument is (and not just test conditions)
