### Reflection
- I was surprised to see the score that collegeboard gave this student. Looking through the written response, I believed that the project fit all the critera.
- Row 1: The student didn't get the point for row 1 since they fit 5 of the 6 critera. Collegeboard believes that the student didn't describe the function's purpose (rather explained its functionality)
    - this was eye-opening, especially since the student response seemed alright to me, and like something I would possibly write. Now I realize that I need to be much more careful and detail oriented to ensure I am going to hit all 6 critera
- Row 3: The student also didn't get the point for row 3 since he met <u>none</u> of the critera.
    - This score was shocking to me. This entire class I have seen lists as easier and usually always helpful. When I looked at this project, I believed that the list was very smart and effective. However, apparently it doesn't contribute to managing complexity. This was also a good warning to me that I need to make sure that my list is actually helping to manage complexity (not all lists are useful)
