![MCQ Test #2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2.jpg)

## Taking the Quiz
- I feel that this quiz was <u>much easier</u> than the final last trimester. I have improved so much with both performance and being mentally prepared (more confidence). I have learned a lot this trimester and have become so much more familiar with the code in these MCQ questions.

## Improvements from Last Time!
- test taking strategies
- more familar with code
- can take code step by step (not freak out when I see it all) 
- more familiar with many of the functions/code that are in the MCQ from this trimester
- I was able to take this test much more quickly and with less stress/uncertainty as the final from last trimester :)
