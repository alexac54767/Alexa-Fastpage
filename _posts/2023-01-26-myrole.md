![ISPE Grades]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ISPEgrades.jpg)
> My portion of the CPT Project is our Independent Sport Physical Education (ISPE) page.
- This page has a feature that allows a student participating in ISPE (getting a PE credit outside of school) to log their sports/workouts and recieve grades for them.
- This page is intended to help ISPE students to stay organized and on top of their workouts to ensure they get the credits for the class
- I have a form where the student inputs:
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Date of Completion
    - Number of Hours Completed
- When they submit, their workout will appear in the table below, along with a corresponding grade.
- this page incorporates CRUD since it will have options for the user to add, edit, and delete their data

## Code Plan
> Frontend:
- the form in which the user inputs the four fields of data is HTML 5 inputs
- Javascript and HTML retreives data from the backend with the api (JSON format) and autogenerates the data into the table
- CSS/HTML/markdown is used to style the page

> Backend
- file "users.py" creates the database (including the classes for users and each table <- ISPE class for my feature)
- file "user.py" creates the api that is the "connector" between frontend and backend


## Video Plan
> In the video, I will demonstrate multiple things:
- input: user inputs a workout by typing these fields into a form and hits submit 
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Date of Completion
    - Number of Hours Completed)
 - output: the data appears in a table below along with a corresponding grade
