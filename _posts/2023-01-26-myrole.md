## Pre-view of materials required for College Board

- Row 1 (Program Purpose and Function): 
    - the purpose of my program is to aid ISPE students to stay organized and ensure they get credit for their class
    - my program works (functionality) by allowing users to log their workouts and then recieve a corresponding grade
    - the user inputs a workout by typing "First Name", "Last Name", "Date of Completion", "Number of Hours Completed" and click submit
    - the output of the program is that the data appears in a table below along with a corresponding grade
- Row 2 (Data Abstraction): 
    - name of collection type will be (class): ISPE
    - data in this class is the data (workouts) that the user inputed
- Row 3 (Managing Complexity):
    - without the use of the class in the database, the inputed data would be very unorganized and would only be stored locally. However, I could store the data in a list and use a rest API.
- Row 4 (Procedural Abstraction): 
    - Show a procedure in creating the API or database? 
    - the API and database are critical to this project since they allow data to be stored (not just locally) and connect the inputs from the frontend to the backend (data a user inputs will show up in table and stay there even when page is refreshed)
- Row 5 (Algorithm Implentation):
    - we haven't finished our code yet
    - describe process of input getting posted to the backend, getting stored in the database, and then sent back to the frontend (table) in JSON format using the API
- Row 6 (Testing): 
    - First call: user inputs a workout into the form and clicks submit
        - result: data will appear in the table below with the corresponding grade
    - Second call: user refreshes page
        - result: since data is stored in a database, the data remains in the table
    - Conditions being tested ?

## My Portion of Create Performance Task Project

![ISPE Grades]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ISPEgrades.jpg)
> My portion of the CPT Project is our Independent Sport Physical Education (ISPE) page.
- This page has a feature that allows a student participating in ISPE (getting a PE credit outside of school) to log their sports/workouts and recieve grades for them.
- This page is intended to help ISPE students to stay organized and on top of their workouts to ensure they get the credits for the class
- I have a form where the student inputs:
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Date of Completion
    - Number of Hours Completed
- When they submit, their workout will appear in the table below, along with a corresponding grade.
- this page incorporates CRUD since it will have options for the user to add, edit, and delete their data

## Code Plan
> Frontend:
- the form in which the user inputs the four fields of data is HTML 5 inputs
- Javascript and HTML retreives data from the backend with the api (JSON format) and autogenerates the data into the table
- CSS/HTML/markdown is used to style the page

> Backend
- file "users.py" creates the database (including the classes for users and each table <- ISPE class for my feature)
- file "user.py" creates the api that is the "connector" between frontend and backend


## Video Plan
> In the video, I will demonstrate multiple things:
- input: user inputs a workout by typing these fields into a form and hits submit 
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Date of Completion
    - Number of Hours Completed)
 - output: the data appears in a table below along with a corresponding grade
