![ISPE Grades]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ISPEgrades.jpg)
> My portion of the CPT Project is our Independent Sport Physical Education (ISPE) page.
- This page has a feature that allows a student participating in ISPE (getting a PE credit outside of school) to log their sports/workouts and recieve grades for them.
- This page is intended to help ISPE students to stay organized and on top of their workouts to ensure they get the credits for the class
- I have a form where the student inputs:
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Date of Completion
    - Number of Hours Completed
- When they submit, their workout will appear in the table below, along with a corresponding grade.
- this page incorporates CRUD since it will have options for the user to add, edit, and delete their data
