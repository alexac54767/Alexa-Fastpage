## Facebook vs Tiktok

- Facebook Age: 25+ (older community)
- Tiktok Age: 10-25 (younger community)
- originally exclusion wasn't purposeful (was popular long ago and continued with that crowd) but now they target the different age groups
- we don't see the exlusion as harmful 
- people may feel more inclined to post/share to others like them
- can target ads towards certain groups (good for business!)


### Female voice: 
- purposeful
- softer, less startling/demanding
- may be subconcscious bias based on old gender roles
- we think the default female voice is good for business, especially since it may be more "trustworthy" in our subconcsciousness

### Algorithm that influences your decisisions
- Amazon targets ads towards certain groups to get them to buy more/specific items
- Netflix targets certain groups to watch shows (ex: teen may want to watch action and an adult would want to watch a documentery)
- Apple may target groups of people (such as runners or sports players) to buy their fitness watches/other products
- Google targets ads/certain searches towards what you are intrested in based off of what you have searched in the past
