## 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns
- License Communities, License Types
    - **closed source** (capitalism, make $): pay to use
    - **open source** (ex: GPL/MIT License): can go grab (concerns: can use but can't sell)
- Digital Rights
    - terms and conditions
    - music
- Patents
    - can pantent phrases like "app store"

### Summary:
> Every company needs to make a living. With capitalism, one of the best ways to do that is with closed source licenses. However, open sourced licenses allow for the code to be more community based. There are more contributions and the code is more useful. However, if you use open sourced code, you cannot sell your product. Similarly, there are digital rights. Every time you accept terms and conditions on your phone/comupter, you are accepting digital rights. Another example of digital rights is licensing to music on your phone. If I pirate music from Beyonce, I am not following her digital rights and she gets less money.

- My team and I chose the open source MIT patent for all our projects. 



## 5.6 Safe Computing
- never ride skateboard and compute at the same time!
- concerns with computing: 
    - malware
    - phishing attacks
    - identity theft
    - stolen information (passwords, credit cards, bank accounts)
- encription:
    - two-factor authentication (2FA)
    - ^ ex: sending email with code/link

## Hacks

- Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
- What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?
- Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
- Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
- Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.
- Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
