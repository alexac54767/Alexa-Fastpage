## Our Project Experience
- This trimester's Night at the Museum went so much better than last trimester.
- My entire group arrived early, and we were set up by 6 PM
- Our project is called Fitness 4 Baddies, and is a tool to all Baddies who want to keep track of/stay motivated with their fitness
- We have features that allow users to input their workouts, grades, inspirations, or exercise ideas
- Our full stack worked well, using a database and get/create/post methods for frontend -> backend -> frontend
