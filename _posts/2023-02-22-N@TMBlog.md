## Our Project Experience
- This trimester's Night at the Museum went so much better than last trimester.
- My entire group arrived early, and we were set up by 6 PM
- Our project is called Fitness 4 Baddies, and is a tool to all Baddies who want to keep track of/stay motivated with their fitness
- We have features that allow users to input their workouts, grades, inspirations, or exercise ideas
- Our full stack worked well, using a database and get/create/post methods for frontend -> backend -> frontend
- however, our AWS was not deployed so we were using localhost to localhost

> My Learning:
- I learned a lot by looking at others projects. Seeing another fitness site was inspiring since there were so many other features that we don't have that contribute to our same topic/idea. I also loved seeing the cool UI and UX from the other projects. My favorite was the cars page. Seeing everyone's creativity was amazing.
