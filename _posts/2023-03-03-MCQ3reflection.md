![MCQ Test #3]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ3.jpg)

## Taking the Quiz
- This was my third time taking an example MCQ test. <u>This was the easiest it's felt</u>. I felt like I was much more efficient and confident in all my answers. I am getting much better at taking a question step by step, and problem solving to get an answer.

## Improvements Since First Test
- test taking strategies
- more familar with code
- can take code step by step (not freak out when I see it all) 
- more familiar with many of the functions/code that are in the MCQ from this trimester
- I was able to take this test much more quickly and with less stress/uncertainty as the final from last trimester :)


## Corrections
### My Score: 48/50

- Question 35: 
    - On this question, I failed to consider all the options. I had assumed that all options would work, however, I failed to consider one order of scores. When I tested out Team C and Team A having the highest score, the program was correct. Although, I didn't realize that if Team B had the highest score but Team C had a higher score than Team A, then team C was incorrectly ruled the winner.

- Question 50:
    - I should have looked at this queston more throughly, and thought of options for values past the provided table. I thought this question was "too easy", since I directly looked at the number of steps when the list size was 5, and chose the options with the lowest number. However, if I looked more carefully, I would've seen that algorithm B grows at an exponential rate. Sure, at a list size of 5 it has the least steps, but it also grows the fastest. 


## Improve for Next Time:
- The next time I take an MCQ test, I want to run more situations through my head. For example, with question number 35, if I thought about all the situations and orders with scores, I could've discovered that option D was faulty.
