![MCQ Test #3]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ3.jpg)

## Taking the Quiz
- This was my third time taking an example MCQ test. <u>This was the easiest it's felt</u>. I felt like I was much more efficient and confident in all my answers. I am getting much better at taking a question step by step, and problem solving to get an answer.

## Improvements Since First Test
- test taking strategies
- more familar with code
- can take code step by step (not freak out when I see it all) 
- more familiar with many of the functions/code that are in the MCQ from this trimester
- I was able to take this test much more quickly and with less stress/uncertainty as the final from last trimester :)


## Corrections
### My Score: 48/50

- Question 13: 
    - This question stumped me a little. To me, all three options seem like they would work and are reasonable. However, I think in order for the expressions to evaluate to false, there needs to be a "NOT" included. That would be why option 1 doesn't fit the critera.

- Question 22:
    - I believe that I read this question incorrectly and needed to read it slower so that I could get every detail. On algorithm A, I read "student adds his or her height to the value on the card" and thought it meant that they only write their height on the card (rather than adding their height to the previous height). I can now see why both of these algorithms would calculate the correct average. 


## Improve for Next Time:
- The next time I take an MCQ test, I want to run more situations through my head. For example, with question number 35, if I thought about all the situations with scores, I could've discovered that option D was faulty.
