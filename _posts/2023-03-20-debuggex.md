## Making my own Database with CRUD
> My database is a shopping list. Users can create, read, update, and delete items from their list, making it convenient to shop and to stay organized.

### [link to my 4.a notebook (my database is at the bottom)](https://alexac54767.github.io/Alexa-Fastpage/2023/03/13/AP-unit2-4a.html)


- **My createitem() function** (as a part of the menu)
      -
![createitem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111482658/226419448-5d10e543-1293-4d65-806f-80a9439a81b3.jpg)

- Step into the function while debugging 
      -  first step in function is to type in the item you want to create, in this example, I am creating the item "Mango"

- The debugger shows every step that the function goes through.
      - This function creates the object and then defines its attributes. The attributes are displayed on the left, which in this case are "Mango", "2", and "Sprouts"

- The menu then displays the created item

- Finally, the newly created item appears in the database.

**- The other CRUD functions incorporated work in a similar way. When I use the debugger, I can see every step that the function goes through, as well as its result.** I think it is so interesting to see how every function is called within the menu and the program then goes to the function and performs it line by line.
