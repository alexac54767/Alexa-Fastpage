## Reflection
- Overall, this quiz felt pretty good. I think I am getting much better at reading the questions, identifying the key parts/information, and answering the question. What I realized with a lot of the questions specifically in Big Idea 2 is that collegeboard provides a lot of unecessary information for the question. So, reading what the question is asking for before reading/analyzing all the data provided has been a strategy of mine. Although I did well on this quiz, there were a couple questions that stumped me for a litte. This problem included:

## Confusing Questions/Topics:
### Question 17
![Q17]({{site.baseurl}}/images/BigIdea2Q17.jpg)
- This question confused me a little. The wording of the answer options was weird, casuing me to believe that multiple of the answers should have worked. However, after looking at the question with more thought and taking it slower, I was able to determine the correct answer.

### Binary
- I have never been super strong at multiplying/adding in my head. I was one of those kids in elementary school where I had to out into the hallway to practive my multiplication cards. So, calculating how many bits are required/converting binary to decmal has always taken me a little and is definitely not free of error. However, this is the topic that my group is taking on for out project. That means I will only continue to get stronger and faster at it, similar to  my multiplication cards after practice.
