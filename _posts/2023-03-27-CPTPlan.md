### [Link to my first draft written portion (incldues link to video)](https://alexac54767.github.io/Alexa-Fastpage/project/CPTwriteup)

### What I still need to do:
- clean up dog hair in my project/personalize
- ^ alter comments throughut code
- go through rubric and ensure that all criteria are hit and that I fully understand the code
- go through previous students' scoring and compare (don't make same mistakes)

### I plan to complete these last to-dos before/during Spring Break.
