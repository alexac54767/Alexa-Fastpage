## Cal State San Marcos
- 21st/23 csu
- improvements! <- new engineering buildings
- national leader in social mobility (internship opportunities)
- ^ rags to riches!
- Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physics, Applied Physics (experimental) Biological Sciences, Computer Science, Cyber Security, Computer Engineering, Engineering (electrical, software), Math
- at CSUSM can switch majors easily (won't loose much progress)
- lots of clubs (STEM opportunities!)

### Internships
- work experience for a limited amount of time
- networking, campus events are great to get internships
- check your email
- google internship opportunities
- try to avoid unpaid internships
- apply if you feel unerqualified! <- worst case they say no, it's meant to be
- ask for help on applications

### Programs at Cal State
- Summer Scholars Program:
    - work and get paid while pursuing your intrest
- Quantum Bridge Program
    - 4 week paid

### Scholarships vs Grant
- grant: government funded to help you get through school
- scholarship: privately funded
- look for scholarships yourself <- can get one for almost anything
- grants: grades matter, based on parents earnings
- apply to be indepent (apply for FASFA) on taxes ASAP so you can have more economic opportunity!!!
- avoid loans, but if you have to (BE SMART WITH LOANS)
    - unsubsidized loan: intrest rates start to increase as soon as you graduate
    - subsidized loan: loan that is parcially funded by government (6 month grace period to pay of intrest)
- google scholarshops and grants that you can apply for

### Life after CSUSM
- after college -> public or private institutions
- look for internships
- can go into graduate programs
- can get paid for masters program (depending on the company/university you are working for)


## Reflection/Takeaways
- failing classes is okay 
- don't let failures define you, keep going!
- grades/scores don't define you
- look for a good support system
- community college and transfer saves a lot of money
- do your research and plan in advance <- can save you a lot of time/money
