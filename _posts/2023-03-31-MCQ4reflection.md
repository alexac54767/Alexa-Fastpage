![MCQ Test #4]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ4.jpg)

## Taking the Quiz
- This was my fourth time taking an example MCQ test. I'm not going to lie, this test was a little more difficult for me. I think this test involved more concepts that I need practice/more research in. I list those topics after my corrections below.

## Improvements Since First Test
- test taking strategies
- more familar with code
- can take code step by step (not freak out when I see it all) 
- more familiar with many of the functions/code that are in the MCQ from this trimester


## Corrections
### My Score: 47/50

![Q20]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q20.jpg)
- Question 20: 
    - On this question, I misunderstood option 3. I thought that the metadeta wouldn't include the actual "name" of the criminals, only the phone number. However, I think they only meant for the list to be of the phone numbers, making both options 2 and 3 correct.

![Q37]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q37.jpg)
- Question 37:
    - I actually got the correct algorithim efficiency for this question. However, I thouight that n^2 was inefficicent. Apparently is is said to run in a reasonable amount of time. 

![Q49]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q49.jpg)
- Question 49:
    - My answer to this question does correctly compare the student scores to the maximum possible score, however, it fails to check the last element on the list. That is why option A is correct, setting the variable "len" to the length of the scores -1.


## Improve for Next Time:
- I think I need to watch the collegeboard videos/research more about the following topics:
    - binary searches
    - data transmissions
    - algorithm efficiency
