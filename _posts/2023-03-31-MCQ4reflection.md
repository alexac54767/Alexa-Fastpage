![MCQ Test #4]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ4.jpg)

## Taking the Quiz
- This was my fourth time taking an example MCQ test. I'm not going to lie, this test was a little more difficult for me. I think this test involved more concepts that I need practice/more research in. I list those topics after my corrections below.

## Improvements Since First Test
- test taking strategies
- more familar with code
- can take code step by step (not freak out when I see it all) 
- more familiar with many of the functions/code that are in the MCQ from this trimester


## Corrections
### My Score: 47/50

![Q20]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q20.jpg)
- Question 20: 
    - On this question, I failed to consider all the options. I had assumed that all options would work, however, I failed to consider one order of scores. When I tested out Team C and Team A having the highest score, the program was correct. Although, I didn't realize that if Team B had the highest score but Team C had a higher score than Team A, then team C was incorrectly ruled the winner.

- Question 37:
    - I should have looked at this queston more throughly, and thought of options for values past the provided table. I thought this question was "too easy", since I directly looked at the number of steps when the list size was 5, and chose the options with the lowest number. However, if I looked more carefully, I would've seen that algorithm B grows at an exponential rate. Sure, at a list size of 5 it has the least steps, but it also grows the fastest.

- Question 49:
    - I should have looked at this queston more throughly, and thought of options for values past the provided table. I thought this question was "too easy", since I directly looked at the number of steps when the list size was 5, and chose the options with the lowest number. However, if I looked more carefully, I would've seen that algorithm B grows at an exponential rate. Sure, at a list size of 5 it has the least steps, but it also grows the fastest. 


## Improve for Next Time:
- I think I need to watch the collegeboard videos/research more about the following activities:
