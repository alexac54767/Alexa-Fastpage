    - Answer= <mark>50 sec</mark>
    - while processes Y and Z are running at the same time (parallel processing), process X will still take 50 seconds
    
- Example 2:

    - Answer= <mark>25 sec</mark>
    - without parallel processing, both processes would take 70 seconds. With parallel processing, they would take 45 seconds. So, the difference is 25 secinds (70-45=25).
