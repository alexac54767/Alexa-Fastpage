![MCQ Test #5]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ5.jpg)

## Taking the Quiz
- This was my fifth time taking an example MCQ test. I feel like this test had a lot more conceptual topics than the previous tests. I definitely had to guess a little (educated guesses based on what I already know). But otherwise, I think I did really well and I am getting much better at the questions that ask about certain code blocks.

## Improvements Since First Test
- test taking strategies
- more familar with code
- can take code step by step (not freak out when I see it all) 
- more familiar with many of the functions/code that are in the MCQ from this trimester
- I was able to take this test much more quickly and with less stress/uncertainty as the final from last trimester :)


## Corrections
### My Score: 65/66

![Q14]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q14.jpg)
- Question 14: 
    - I am still a little confused by this question. I didn't realize that the order of where the "i <- i + 1" did not affect the amount of values. However, since i is displayed after this expression, it doesn't display "1", but instead lists the 10 values starting at "2". I assumed that program A would display one more value than program B.


## Improve for Next Time:
- Next time I take a test, I want to spend more time running through questions like #14. I could have "ran" the programs in my head to see the outputs. However, I have to be careful of time constraints to prepare for the AP test.
