![MCQ Test 2020]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2020MCQ.png)

## Taking the Quiz
- This was my sixth time taking an example MCQ test. I feel like this test had a lot more conceptual topics than the previous tests. I definitely had to guess a little (educated guesses based on what I already know). Out of the questions I got wrong, a few definitely surprised me. I didn't have much doubt in my answers so I was surprised that I was wrong (it's givin AP Calc)

## Improvements Since First Test
- test taking strategies
- more familar with code
- can take code step by step (not freak out when I see it all) 
- more familiar with many of the functions/code that are in the MCQ from this trimester
- I was able to take this test much more quickly and with less stress/uncertainty as the final from last trimester :)


## Corrections
### My Score: 63/67

![Q15]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2020Q15.png)
- Question 15: 
    - This was completely my dumb mistake. I was supposed to compare output of program a and b, but I thought I remembered this question from the last test. I didn't look at the images specifically and assumed the answer was the same. Oopsies (I won't do that on the AP test).

![Q36]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2020Q36.png)
- Question 36: 
    - I assumed that accuracy would be the most affected/focused on by Collegeboard. However, it now makes sense to me that best/most likey answer is that the simulation would be more efficient. 


![Q50]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2020Q50.png)
- Question 50: 
    - Once again, me and collegeboard disagree about what we consider "reasonable" runtime. I need to keep in mind that collegeboard thinks almost any runtime is reasonable.


![Q51]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2020Q51.png)
- Question 51: 
    - This question is my bad. I need to study the different types of licenses and what each one means. This part of the AP conent is more memorization.

## Improve for Next Time:
- Next time I take a test, I want to spend more time running through questions. I could have "ran" the programs in my head to see the outputs. However, I have to be careful of time constraints to prepare for the AP test. I also need to study the topics that take more memorization.
