## Corrections
### My Score: 62/70

![Q3]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q32021.png)
- Question 3: 
    - This was just a dumb mistake. I should have looked at it more clearly.

![Q9]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q92021.png)
- Question 9: 
    -  This question definitely stumped me. When I read the option I chose, the "sequence of operations" reminded me of how data is transmitted in packets with meta data describing how to mut them back together. So, I thought these operations would describe how to "recreate" the audio signal. However, now that I look at it more, I realize that it makes much more sense that the signal would be trasmitted as a sequence of bits.


![Q17]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q172021.png)
- Question 17: 
    - This was also just a dumb mistake. I think I was trying to rush and didn't look at the diagram closely enough.


![Q23]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q232021.png)
- Question 23: 
    - This was a conceptial mistake. Oopie.

![Q43]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q432021.png)
- Question 43: 
    - This is a word that I need to study. I have just researched keylogging and now I understand how it is the tracking of computer movements.

![Q50]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q502021.png)
- Question 50: 
    - This was anther term I didn't know when taking this test. I now know that symmetric encryption uses one key instead of both a public key and a private key.

![Q60]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q602021.png)
- Question 60: 
    - I overthought this question. I thought collegeboard was trying to trick mw with an "obvious answer" but turns out it was actually correct. Oops.

![Q66]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q662021.png)
- Question 66: 
    - I'm not gonna lie this question is confusing. I still am trying to figure out how it works (will probably be an OHH moment and then wonder how I'm so stupid but currently I am still in the stupid stage)


## Improve for AP Exam:
- I think I did really well on time. So, I think the AP test will go well, especially since I will have paper to write out my thoughts on. However, I need to make sure I try to be efficient but careful with my answers. A few of my mistakes on this test were just because I was rushing. I do need to study a few more vocablary terms before the test, such as keylogging and the licenses one can get and its terms.
