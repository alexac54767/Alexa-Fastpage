## Topic: Music
## Members: Ava and Alexa Carlson (the iconic duo)
## Name: Maniac Music
> This project will be about everything music. We are planning on focusing on generating song recommenations and concert availability. Users will hopefully be able to search for songs with certian aspects (such as genre or artist) and look for concerts for specific artists in their area.

### Incoorporating a Sorting Algorithm
> Spotify
- We will be using an API (going to try Spotify) to fetch songs and their meta data.
- Our program will be able to use that meta data and have different sorting options.
- Some options include genre, artist, and playlists.

> Concerts
- We will also be using an API (going to try SeatGeeks) to fetch data about available concerts
- Like the music, it will be able to sort by artist, genre of their music, ratings, and possibly the distance from the user

### Incoorporating Filtering of Data
> Spotify
- Similarly, we will be using a search algorithm where users can search for a specific song, artist, or genre. 
- The search algorithm will filter through the meta data of the songs and display only the ones that fit the user's specifications.

> Concerts
- Also, like spotify, a user will be able to use the search algorithm in the concerts feature
- it will use the data from the API to sort through concerts that fit the user's prefrences
- for example, the filters may be: 
    1. Coldplay
    2. Within 200 miles
    3. On a weekend
