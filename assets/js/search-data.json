What is a modern day game that could be classified as a 2D array A modern day game that could be classified as a 2D array is Chess. | . | Describe a 2D array in your own words a 2D array is a list of lists with similar values ### 2: Iteration Robot Game:- What is the defenition of iteration in your own words - Iteration is the process of simplifying/making code more efficient by allowing for loops and repeating steps | . | Explain how the game relates to itertation The game uses iteration to move the robot to a certain position with only a few lines of instruction that repeat. | . | What parts of the code use iteration (game example) The game utilizes iteration multiple times. Any level that involves a loop, uses iteration. Leves 2 through 5 have iteration. In your backend code for the game, many for loops are used to have a condition for every possiblility of the user&#39;s action/movement. | . | Explain which parts of the code use lists The backend code for the game uses a movement list that stores the user&#39;s input. The list allows the code to iterate through it with a series of for loops. | . | Explain what list manipulation is happening in that part The list has movements getting appended to it, and is analyzed and indexed. | . | .

Dylan is good to go! Neil is good to go! . 2D Array Hacks . Tic Tac Toe game works by defining the variable &quot;board&quot; with 3 different lists (which is a 2D array.) It then defines a funtion where it prints the board and a function that checks if there is a win or a tie. Finally, it defines the function &quot;play_game&quot; that has a while loop that contains conditionals. It takes the user&#39;s inut and calls the functions defined earlier. | 3 examples of games that can be made from 2D arrays are snake, connect 4, and a maze. | . Lists and Dictionaries Hacks . The difference between lists and dictionaries: lists use [] | dictionaries use {} | lists have items | dictionaries have keys and values | lists are ordered | dicitonaries are unordered | Lists can contain elements of any data type (dictinaries can&#39;t with keys) | Lists can be accessed with index numbers | Dictionaries can be accessed with keys | . | . # list fav_foods = [&#39;mac and cheese&#39;, &#39;pinapple&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;cheeze-its&#39;] fav_foods.append(&#39;coffee&#39;) fav_foods.remove(&#39;bread&#39;) print(fav_foods) # dictionary person = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;John&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 16, &#39;city&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;} person[&#39;age&#39;] = 17 # chagnes value for the key &quot;age&quot; person[&#39;GPA&#39;] = &#39;4.0&#39; # adds new vey/value del person[&#39;city&#39;] # deletes the key/calue print(person) .

I definitely had to guess a little (educated guesses based on what I already know). But otherwise, I think I did really well and I am getting much better at the questions that ask about certain code blocks. | . Improvements Since First Test . test taking strategies | more familar with code | can take code step by step (not freak out when I see it all) | more familiar with many of the functions/code that are in the MCQ from this trimester | I was able to take this test much more quickly and with less stress/uncertainty as the final from last trimester :) | . Corrections . My Score: 65/66 . . Question 14: I am still a little confused by this question. I didn’t realize that the order of where the “i &lt;- i + 1” did not affect the amount of values. However, since i is displayed after this expression, it doesn’t display “1”, but instead lists the 10 values starting at “2”. I assumed that program A would display one more value than program B. | . | . Improve for Next Time: . Next time I take a test, I want to spend more time running through questions like #14. I could have “ran” the programs in my head to see the outputs. However, I have to be careful of time constraints to prepare for the AP test. | .",

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control. . Fault Tolerance . Watch both Daily videos for 4.2 . Complete the network activity, summarize your understanding of fault tolerance. Example 1: | This example is fault tolerant since there are at least 2 paths to every letter. That way, if one path would go out, the network would still have ways to access the letter. | . | Example 2: | This example is not fault tolerant. The letter F only has one path to access it. That means that if it goes out, F would be cut off completely, making the network is not fault tolerant. | . | Example 3: | This example is not fault tolerant since A to G only has one path. If it were to go out, the letter A would be competely cut off. This means that the network is not fault tolerant. | . | I have learned that when looking to see if a network is fault tolerant, you have to investigate all of the parts. In both of these examples that aren’t fault tolerant, only one letter is the issue. Every other piece has multiple paths to it. So, you have to look carefully to ensure a network is in fact, fault tolerant. | Question 1: | No matter how many paths are available for data to take in a network, it will only end up using one. This means having a fault tolerant network is “unecessary” in this situation (nothing goes wrong, fragile netowrk). | . | Question 2: | Adding a connection between A and B would allow A to have more than 1 path, making the network fault-tolerant. | . | . | .

            "title": "Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions",
            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is _O(n). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # I notice that the output only has 3 values, with no repetition. # In the original list, there are repeats for a total of 5 values. # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # I think sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables since they both don&#39;t allow duplicates. . {1, 2, 3} .

How this Code utilizes binary: . I asked Chat GPT and this is what it said: | &quot;This code does not utilize binary directly, but it uses base64 encoding to represent the PIL image data in a format that can be displayed in HTML. The image_to_base64() function converts the PIL image data to a base64-encoded string, which is then used to embed the image in an HTML tag. The base64-encoded string is essentially a binary representation of the image data that can be transmitted over the web. The resulting image is displayed using the display() function from IPython.display, which renders the HTML in the Jupyter Notebook environment.&quot; | . Other Binary Image Ideas: .

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . A programmer should care about space and time complexity because a programmer wants to have the most efficient running program. Maybe a more complicated system with high powered computers and storage would be able to have a more complicated program that requires more time and space. | .

Constant O(1) | Linear O(n) | Quadratic O(n^2) | Logarithmic O(logn) | Exponential (O(2^n)) | . numbers = list(range(1000)) print(numbers) . Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) #print(fibonacci(34)) print(fibonacci(40)) . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) print(generate_subsets([1,2,3,4,5,6])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(37)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. linear O(n) = good (goes through loop), pretty efficient time | quadratic O(n^2) or O(2^n) = terrible (has a nested loop and prints 1000x1000), very slow | logarithmic O(log(n)) = very good and efficient (binary search algorithm) | . | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. Great website for sorting algorithms | selection sort= simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list | bubble sort= simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order (not efficient) | heap sort= comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure (similar to the selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning,repeat the same process for remaining elements) | here are some visual representations of these algorithims: selection sort | bubble sort | heap sort | . | . | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? time and space complexity are important when choosing an algorithm since you want the most efficient program as possible. If you know that your data set is too large and will take far too much space/time to perform the algorithm, you need a more complex algorithm that is more efficent. | . | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? I think you should use both in different situations. In the example above, the constant time algorithm was sufficient for displaying &quot;numbers&quot;. However, since &quot;numbers&quot; was a large data set, it was very inefficient for the exponential algorithm. If &quot;numers&quot; was 1-10, the exponential would have been sufficient. | . | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? I noticed that the more loops an algorithm has, the slower it is. For example, with the quadratic time algorithm, it has a nested loop. This causes it to have to run through the loops 1000 times (size of &quot;numbers&quot;), printing 1000 x 1000. This is very inefficient compared to the single loop of the linear time algorithm. | . | . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below.

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

            "content": "Enumerate &quot;Data&quot; Big Idea from College Board . Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. - Clouds Impression . Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab | Size, height and width, number of pixels | Visual perception, lossy compression | . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . Introduction to displaying images in Jupyter notebook . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? Mac uses &quot;cd&quot; and &quot;ls&quot; | . | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? I use &quot;ls&quot; to see what files I have and &quot;cd&quot; to access my files. Windows can also use &quot;C:/&quot;.- What are some of the major differences? | Mac does not have the command &quot;C:&quot;, which will return to the home directory on Windows. | . | . Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? The path is how the program will locate the images. If the path is wrong in anyway or is not specific enough, the image will not be located and therfore not displayed. | . | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? The meta data source and label involve crediting others and following their licenses if they havre them. This way, if the owner of the images has a license (such as an MIT), they can get the credit they need. | . | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? Ipython is very intresting. It allows Jupyter notebooks to have a specific kernel to run python code. It also has a class format that can be used to display images and pandas. | . | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Yellow Smiley Face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;yellowsmileyface.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . - Base64 is similar to Binary and Hexadecimal in which it holds a certain amount of data in bits. However, it stores ASCII binary data as a string format . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. Ale = QWxl | . | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? Especially in this class, I habe been a consumer to buffering. A good example of this is when I have to wait longer for my VScode changes to commit, since it has a lot of data and space taken up in a file. | . | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? I have experienced lags and have been victim to a page that feels like it would never load. | . | How do these effects apply to images? These effects apply to images since a large file may add more to the queue, which causes a lag. The image may take a little time to appear. | . | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? Yes, this code defines a lot of functions that include iteration like for loops. When these functions are called, it has a lot of sequencing in order to resize, change the format, retrieve data, and then edit the data. | . | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? The grey scale algorithm retrives the Numpy Array which includes all the RGB values for the image. It then averages out all the reds, greens, and blues by adding up their values and dividing by 3. This is what creates the grey scale. | . | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? The function scale image sets the base of the image as the desired size. It then uses other functions to scale the other parts of the image (like height) to stay proportional to the base. You can see this function working, when the green sqare image was once very tiny and is now a much larger sqare (still proportional). | . | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Yes, scaling images are a type of compression. It is compressing an image into a different size and trying to keep all the details. I think shrinking an image is a lossy compression since it has to scale down the amount of pixels and details. However, increasing an image size would probably be lossless, since it is gaining more pixels. | . | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39;

I asked chat GPT, and there are definitely a few things that the PIL library can do to avoid lossy data with image compression: . Use the &#39;save&#39; function with a lossless compression format like PNG or TIFF instead of lossy formats like JPEG. This will preserve all the original data without any loss. . | If you need to use a lossy compression format like JPEG, you can control the level of compression using the &#39;save&#39; function&#39;s &#39;quality&#39; parameter. Higher quality levels will result in less data loss, but also larger file sizes. . | You can also use the &#39;resize&#39; function to reduce the image size before compression. This will reduce the amount of data that needs to be compressed, which can help to reduce the loss of data. . | Another option is to use the &#39;filter&#39; function to apply a smoothing or blurring filter to the image before compression. This can help to reduce the amount of detail in the image, which can make it easier to compress without losing too much data. . | Finally, you can use the &#39;quantize&#39; function to reduce the number of colors in the image. This can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be compressed, which can help to reduce the loss of data. However, this can also result in a loss of detail and color accuracy in the image. . | . from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image, ImageFilter from IPython.display import display def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): if images is None: images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Hand Out&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;handout.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # Open the image img = Image.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Apply the blur filter img = img.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR) # Update the filename to the blurred image blurred_filename = &quot;blurred-&quot; + image[&#39;file&#39;] image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / blurred_filename # Save the blurred image img.save(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Display the blurred image display(img) image_data() .

Improvements Since First Test . test taking strategies | more familar with code | can take code step by step (not freak out when I see it all) | more familiar with many of the functions/code that are in the MCQ from this trimester | I was able to take this test much more quickly and with less stress/uncertainty as the final from last trimester :) | . Corrections . My Score: 48/50 . . Question 35: On this question, I failed to consider all the options. I had assumed that all options would work, however, I failed to consider one order of scores. When I tested out Team C and Team A having the highest score, the program was correct. Although, I didn’t realize that if Team B had the highest score but Team C had a higher score than Team A, then team C was incorrectly ruled the winner. | . | . . Question 50: I should have looked at this queston more throughly, and thought of options for values past the provided table. I thought this question was “too easy”, since I directly looked at the number of steps when the list size was 5, and chose the options with the lowest number.

However, I could store the data in a list and use a rest API to connect the frontend and backend. However, it would be very tedious since I would have to manually add data to the backend. It would be much more difficult to update, debug, and add data. . | Row 4 (Procedural Abstraction): | . . This function “create_ISPE” takes the iputted data (parameter) and iterates through the variables that the user inputs (name, date, duration, grade). It then defines them as constants, posts them, and autogenerates them into the table diplayed on frontend. This allows the data inputed by the user to actually show up in the table, carrying out the purpose of the program. . | Row 5 (Algorithm Implentation): . | . . This class in my API is defining a get funtion that recieves the data from the frontend, and jsonifies the data. It does this by going through a sequence where it first extracts all the exisiting data, reads it, and then rewrites it as a JSON format. The second piece of code pictured then fetches the data that is in JSON format by using GET methods. This frontend uses the funtion read_ISPE to refrense the class_read function in the backend. In order to do this, it goes through a series of conditionals (selection), to determine if the data is valid and ready to be added to the database. If it produces a response error, then the funtion is returned. If the data is valid and in the correct format, then it will be added to the table which will be displayed to the user. . | Row 6 (Testing): .

Starting off with little knowlege on databases, this project was definitely difficult. By using the resources Mr. Mortensen gave us and a lot of troubleshooting/debugging, we were able to accomplish this project! . having multiple classes within one database: we originally didn’t understand that we needed different database files, we started off with one that had 4 different classes. It had worked and showed up correctly in our SQLite table, however, it made it very difficult to create and connect an API to it. Once we had seperate files, it was much easier to keep track of our work and add other elements. | defining vars and notes schema for our projects (determining what type of input each var was going to be) | SYNTAX! Trying to debug syntax was definitely a challenge. It took looking at errors, changing one thing at a time, and testing over and over again. Things like a capital letter or an underbar before a var made all the difference. | Garbage Data: I spent lots of time trying to determine how I could make the API the most efficient in eliminating garbage data. However, with the input of others, I realized that one of the most effective ways to do this is to not allow the user to input incorrect values in the first place. So, I changed the HTML 5 input type on frontend to only allow the user to input certain options. | Setter/Getter Functions: These still confuse me a little. I understand that these funtions are necessary to create a var and to retrieve their data. However, editing them was difficult. I needed to take it much slower than I normally do, since it requires more attention to detail. Many elements needed to be added/changed between vars, and I made lots of little mistakes. These mistakes made it tedious to test and debugg my code. | . Our Main Strategies: . Teamwork! If one member had an issue, we all tried to help and solve it. | Sharing our mistakes and solutions: Many times if there was an issue in our code that was not a typo/misunderstanding, we all had the same issue. So, when we troubleshooted and debugged to form a solution, we shared that fix with the group. | Comparing code: This strategy helped us greatly in this project. If one member’s code was working as intended but another’s had errors, we compared the code side by side to see if we could identify an error. We caught many mistakes/typos this way. | .",

Summary: . Every company needs to make a living. With capitalism, one of the best ways to do that is with closed source licenses. However, open sourced licenses allow for the code to be more community based. There are more contributions and the code is more useful. However, if you use open sourced code, you cannot sell your product. Similarly, there are digital rights. Every time you accept terms and conditions on your phone/comupter, you are accepting digital rights. Another example of digital rights is licensing to music on your phone. If I pirate music from Beyonce, I am not following her digital rights and she gets less money. .

However, our frontend repository already had the “Apache” license so we left that one in place. The MIT license allows anyone to edit, ditribute, or use it personally or commercially, as long as they give us credit.

What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? I always feel a little nervous about having my information out. But, I do put myself out there with things like social media so my name and some basic info (such as DNHS, class of 2024, my cheerleading organization/team) are open to the world to see. I realize that is probably a little more risky, however, it allows others to connect with me (like if a cheerleader from the same organization found my account). Also, my common email happens to be my first, middle, and last name all in one. I have been told that it is dumb to be giving out that information, but I have yet to stop using that email. | . | . . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. a good password is one that has many characters, both letters and numbers, and symbols. It is more difficult to guess and come up with. Bad passwords are either very common and not intricate, or contain personal information. For example, if I made my password alexac, it would be very bad since my name is very accessible (PII). | . | . . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption only uses one key to encrypt/decrypt. It is a form of security, but isn’t as strong as Asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys, a public and secret key, to encrypt and decrypt. | . | . . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. When creating and deploying our projects in AWS, we used Asymmetric encryption. We had to generate the public and secret keys and then add them to our repositories. | . | . .

There was one I fell for a long time ago where one of my “friends” on insta direct messaged me a link that they claimed had a “bad photo” of me. Theyt made it sound urgent and I was curious. In order to “view the photos” you had to sign into your instagram account. I tried to multiple times, but lucklily forgot my password. Ava then pointed out to me that it was clearly a scheme, and that I should avoid clicking on anything suspicious on instagram dms. | . | .",

He seemed very passionate about the fact that the computers are racist, and that the software doesn’t work on his darker skin. | . | How do you think this happened? I think that this was a testing error. The lack of diversity in the programming and testing led this mistake to be released into the world. However, I don’t believe they originally set out to be racist. | . | Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Yes, I think this is harmful, but was not intended to be. Groups may feel excluded and “not normal”, contributing to the issue of racism and lack of self worth. | . | Should it be corrected? Yes, I think that HP should (maybe already did) correct this issue right away. | . | What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? They need to test all groups (diverse people working on the project) to ensure it is equal over all groups | . | . Conclusion . There are biases everywere. In technology, in developing, in testing, and there are even biases in our subconcsiousness. They are hard to avoid, however, we can attempt to counteract them by considering how we can incoorporate all (or as many as we can) groups and perspectives.

Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. At N@TM, I could go around asking everyone what sport they play/activities they do to help their fitness. If they did a workout recently, they could log it on our site. Also, they could use our “sports workout” page to input what they do to workout.

Corrections . My Score: 46/50 . . Question 13: This question stumped me a little. To me, all three options seem like they would work and are reasonable. However, I think in order for the expressions to evaluate to false, there needs to be a “NOT” included. That would be why option 1 doesn’t fit the critera. | . | . . Question 22: I believe that I read this question incorrectly and needed to read it slower so that I could get every detail. On algorithm A, I read “student adds his or her height to the value on the card” and thought it meant that they only write their height on the card (rather than adding their height to the previous height). I can now see why both of these algorithms would calculate the correct average. | . | . . Question 24: This question definitely worked my brain. I thought that since the innermost block was repeated y times, and that was repeated 3 times, that the answer would be y^3. However, after reading their explanation it makes much more sense now. Since the | “The value of the variable result is initially set to 0. The outer REPEAT block is executed three times, and the inner REPEAT block is executed y times. Any block inside both of these blocks will be executed 3y (3 multiplied by y) times. Since the innermost block increases the value of the variable result by 1, the final value of the variable result is 3y.” | . | . . Question 30: This question definitely confused me. I think I am starting to understand it though. It gives coordinates of a point on a circle, as well as its radius. It then calls the function “drawCircle(x, y, r)” before subtraction from y and r. Or, it adds to y and r and then calls the function “drawCircle(x, y, r)”. I was confused about when the function should be called. It should be called before subtraction, but after addition. | . | .

Layout files in _layouts/default.html, structure is provided by GitHub pages theme | Supplement layout with files in _includes, for instance _layouts/home.html is used to add menu selections to pages by including it in _layouts/default.html. | . | Page. Markdown or HTML is defined and constructed into page using Jekyll Build, refer to content reference in _layouts/default.html. Observe how files are built by looking at generated html files under _site. | . View/CRUD Concepts . In a database project, the key idea is to build a system for capturing key information. For instance, student information on students and allowing *blogging to a Teacher would have Frontend View elements that correspond to a Backend Database. . Backend Database CRUD operations are as follows... . Create new student records | Read a list of students | Update student data | Delete records | . Frontend Visual concepts of the Idea . HTML to Obtain Input is a key step (aka Create/Input Step) . HTML5 table is a way to organize input . th labels | td input types | onclick action | . /* &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;password&quot;&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;phone&quot;&gt;Phone&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; required&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; id=&quot;email&quot; placeholder=&quot;abc@xyz.org&quot; required&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot; id=&quot;password&quot; required&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;tel&quot; name=&quot;phone_num&quot; id=&quot;phone_num&quot; pattern=&quot;[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}&quot; placeholder=&quot;999-999-9999&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td &gt;&lt;button onclick=&quot;create_User()&quot;&gt;Create&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; */ .

HTML and JavaScript Display Table . JavaScript below shows elements needed to construct the rows of data in the table. . JSON is required, it is hardcoded in this example. Typically JSON will come from a JavaScript fetch. | JSON object is required, it is created from JSON string. This allows access to to elements in JSON using JavaScript dot notation (user._name) | DOM editing is a huge part of the remainder of this example. DOM elements often nest inside of other DOM elements. For instance each td is nested in tr. Find examples of DOM create and append in the code below. | Notice the definition of table and build you own map or visual of how these things are put together. | . /* &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;ID&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Actions&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody id=&quot;table&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- javascript generated data --&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; */ // Static json, this can be used to test data prior to API and Model being ready const json = &#39;[{&quot;_name&quot;: &quot;Thomas Edison&quot;, &quot;_uid&quot;: &quot;toby&quot;}, {&quot;_name&quot;: &quot;Nicholas Tesla&quot;, &quot;_uid&quot;: &quot;nick&quot;}, {&quot;_name&quot;: &quot;John Mortensen&quot;, &quot;_uid&quot;: &quot;jm1021&quot;}, {&quot;_name&quot;: &quot;Eli Whitney&quot;, &quot;_uid&quot;: &quot;eli&quot;}, {&quot;_name&quot;: &quot;Hedy Lemarr&quot;, &quot;_uid&quot;: &quot;hedy&quot;}]&#39;; // Convert JSON string to JSON object const data = JSON.parse(json); // prepare HTML result container for new output const table = document.getElementById(&quot;table&quot;); data.forEach(user =&gt; { // build a row for each user const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); // td&#39;s to build out each column of data const name = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const id = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const action = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // add content from user data name.innerHTML = user._name; id.innerHTML = user._uid; // add action for update button var updateBtn = document.createElement(&#39;input&#39;); updateBtn.type = &quot;button&quot;; updateBtn.className = &quot;button&quot;; updateBtn.value = &quot;Update&quot;; updateBtn.style = &quot;margin-right:16px&quot;; updateBtn.onclick = function () { alert(&quot;Update: &quot; + user._uid); }; action.appendChild(updateBtn); // add action for delete button var deleteBtn = document.createElement(&#39;input&#39;); deleteBtn.type = &quot;button&quot;; deleteBtn.className = &quot;button&quot;; deleteBtn.value = &quot;Delete&quot;; deleteBtn.style = &quot;margin-right:16px&quot; deleteBtn.onclick = function () { alert(&quot;Delete: &quot; + user._uid); }; action.appendChild(deleteBtn); // add data to row tr.appendChild(name); tr.appendChild(id); tr.appendChild(action); // add row to table table.appendChild(tr); }); .

A notes/blog would be created to add Notes between students and teacher, part of original concept. Notes could be used for many types of applications. Details on creating notes will be part of another blog, but for now we want you to think about design. . In this design, most recent messages are on top | Messages are intended to support markdown and inclusion of images | Think about technique to format images in conjunction with Text | . Hacks . Build and correlate a technical design between frontend view and backend model. This blog is focussing on frontend view., and visual concepts on how CRUD operations are presented to user of system. This particular Jupyter Notebook and code within it are used to help establish technical ideas. Start a design for your project... . Each project must have a View (as pictured) and Model (json data is fetched into the View). Describe your project. | Describe your View. Use Markdown, HTML, UML, other visuals, tables are used to characterize a project. This shows the Teacher and Graders understanding of planning Model and View. | Transition from pure design and start inserting code elements, like inputs. Also, try build a table with json data versus fetching data. | Issues should discuss problems/challenges, in Teacher/Student data here are a couple ... This design will have many JavaScript actions, at least one for each CRUD operation. In this design, developer needs think of JavaScript functions to replace placeholder alerts in example code above. | There can be different roles for CRUD operations. For instance, student will only interact with their own account. Teacher may interact with many accounts. | Given these CRUD operations what kind of APIs are needed? They should map closely button/on click actions, as each action will fetch or manipulate data differently. | . | . Extra Credit. Student(s) could assist in rework of my Flask project from last year into a Frontend / Backend solution. Additionally, if Frontend is done correctly it could easily be modified to work with both Spring and Flask backends. . References . Here are some working samples .

I was surprised to see the score that collegeboard gave this student. Looking through the written response, I believed that the project fit all the critera. | Row 1 (Program Purpose and Function): The student didn’t get the point for row 1 since they fit 5 of the 6 critera. Collegeboard believes that the student didn’t describe the function’s purpose (rather explained its functionality) this was eye-opening, especially since the student response seemed alright to me, and like something I would possibly write. Now I realize that I need to be much more careful and detail oriented to ensure I am going to hit all 6 critera | . | Row 3 (Managing Complexity): The student also didn’t get the point for row 3 since he met none of the critera. This score was shocking to me. This entire class I have seen lists as easier and usually always helpful. When I looked at this project, I believed that the list was very smart and effective. However, apparently it doesn’t contribute to managing complexity. This was also a good warning to me that I need to make sure that my list is actually helping to manage complexity (not all lists are useful) | . | . . Submission #2 . My Score: 5/6 . Link to my rubric . Collegeboard Score: 6/6 . Link to their rubric . Reflection . Row 5 (Algorithm Implentation): I scored differently than college board on one the the critera here. I thought that the student didn’t describe the code enough that one would be able to re-create it. However, that probably just reflects my current abilities in coding (especically compared to an expert working for collegeboard.) | I believe that this student did a wonderful job. I really love how they put text boxes within the images of code to describe it as they went. It made it much more organized and easier to follow. | The student was also very thorough with all their explanations.

The student incorrectly identifies the input and output, and descrived the functionality as the purpose. Thier given purpose was incorrect. | . | Row 2 (Data Abstraction): The student recieved a 0 on this section from Collegeboard, but I gave it a 1. They did have images of lists and identified a name, however, the name did not correleate to the images provided. | When I do my project, I need to make sure I spend careful attention to details, and make sure every description matches my images. | . | Row 3 (Managing Complexity): Both Collogeboard and I gave a 0 for this section. The images did not show a list being used, and the code was not complex. | the sudent did not explain how the list manages complexity | I need to make sure that my project will have a list that actually manges complexity and is useful | . | Row 4 (Procedural Abstraction): The student recieved a 0 on this section from Collegeboard, but I gave it a 1. the response does not describe how this procedure contributes to the overall functionality | . | Row 5 (Algorithm Implentation): Both Collogeboard and I gave a 0 for this section. the description of the program was brief and doesn’t allow for someone to recreate it | . | What I’ve learned with this project and scoring is that I will need to follow the directions completely when I do my project. | . .

The response gives the conditions being tested rather than two different arguments that cause a different segment of code to execute. Arguments should be specific values used in the call to the procedure. | this is the first time I’ve seen this score for section 6.

This code takes the item in the tasks list and prints them as they go. Then, it appends the item into a &quot;finished&quot; list.

Kathyleen Beveridge: . first job = investment banker with Wells Fargo (wasn’t her thing) | switched to high tech industry with job at HP | took 6 months off | worked at Qualcomm | now works at Thermo Fisher Scientific as senior director of marketing and sales ^ she works in a similar scrum process with sprints and positions (Scrum Master, Dev Ops, etc) | uses databases and data science to predict sales, weather (wine harvest), etc. Non-technical roles = recommending clients to buy certain things/do things | . | . Kris Porter: . main job: Software engineer (SRE, DevOps, Infrastructure) | first job = fixed computers/other tech | job at start up (GPM) and worked email marketing automation (similar to DevOps) | job at NBC Universal (streaming media infrastructure) | job at Qualcomm (Dev ops job, automation) | job at Twitter (worked on API which requested from client and retrieve info from all users and resurface important stuff back to client) Twitter Projects= New DataCenter Deployment &amp; Migrating HomeTimeline to GraphQL | . | . Important Tips/Skills: . career paths won’t always be a striaght line | Be adaptive | it’s okay if you’re not sure what your intrests are yet | Best technicians: listen and solve technical requirements (can explain in non-technical terms) | continuous learning | “Learn how to learn” = always be ready to learn more | learn multiple programming languages | don’t be super concerned about things you read on the news (resiliance) | the only risk is not learning | set good balance between work/hobbies and necessities | . My Reflection: . I know I enjoy STEM classes, especially math. I also love APCSP when I can figure the problem/code out. However, sometimes I feel dicouraged to pursue opportunities or careers in computer science/tech because I find it difficult. However, after listening to Kris and Kathleen, I feel like I still am able to go into this industry. | .",

For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. . 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. . 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. . 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. .

C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . Which answers could not be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 . B. 9 1 8 .

Basics of Procedures | Calling Procedures | Determine Results of Procedures | . What is a procedure? . Essential Knowledge: . A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. May be called &quot;method&quot; or &quot;function&quot; in different programming languages. | . | Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How? | . Example: . What is the procedure&#39;s name? | What are the parameters? | What did the procedure return? | . x = 5 y = 3 def multiply(x, y): product = x * y return product answer = multiply(x, y) print(&quot;The product of&quot;, x, &quot;times&quot;, y, &quot;is&quot;, answer) . The product of 5 times 3 is 15 . Calling Procedures . To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there | . Ex: . procedureName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) | How would you call this procedure? | . num = 5 def math(x): # math(any number) would call the the procedure op1 = x * 2 op2 = op1 - 9 return op2 .

Determining the Result of a Procedure . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . | Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters | return value and statements | . | . To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var | . A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . | Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . | . Ex: . def divide(num1,num2): x = num1/num2 return x . what is x being assigned to inside the function? . | As a reminder, to use function parameters, you would have to write the syntax name of the function followed by the parameters needed in parentheses . | Function parameters are the parameters that are used when calling the function in order to get a result. . | . What are the function parameters in this procedure? . What values are being passed to the function? . def function(first_name, last_name): print(first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name) function(&quot;Peter&quot;,&quot;Parker&quot;) function(&quot;Safin&quot;, &quot;Singh&quot;) . Peter Parker Safin Singh . In the cell above, the function is being called twice, which shows the importance of function in order to accomplish the same thing with different parameters. . What is wrong with the function? . Can you translate the binary numbers into decimal notation? . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) return result cube = find_cube(3) cube2 = find_cube(4) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube2 ) . Cube: 0b11011 Cube: 0b1000000 . Once again, I called the function twice, which is useful, because it allows the coder to do the same thing multiple times with different arguments. . Topic 3.13 (3.B) Managing Complexity - Safin . Overview: Learning Objectives . increasing code modularity using procedures abstracting large problems into smaller ones | extract shared features to reduce code duplication | . | using parameters to reuse procedures | improving code readability with procedures | manipulating procedure logic and preserving outputEssentially, we&#39;ll learn how and when it is appropriate to construct a function (procedural abstraction) and what its benefits are . | . Vocabulary: . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . Parameters . As we saw above, parameters can be used to make functions work with multiple different inputs. Let&#39;s review the following code . # these parameters are the inputs to the function, and they are used # inside the function to perform some operation def add(x, y): # inside the function, we can use the x and y parameters just like # we would use any other variable result = x + y return result # to call the function and pass in values for the x and y parameters, # we simply provide the values as arguments in the function call result = add(2, 3) print(result) # should output 5 # we can also use variables as arguments in the function call x = 5 y = 10 result = add(x, y) print(result) # should output 15 # we can even use the result of one function call as an argument # in another function call result = add(add(2, 3), add(4, 5)) print(result) # should output 14 . 5 15 14 . In the above example, parameters were used to create a function that could be called multiple times without code duplication. . Modularity . In the following example, we will use specialized functions and explain their benefits: . import math def hypotenuse(leg1, leg2): # notice we&#39;re using this &lt;var&gt; * &lt;var&gt; syntax multiple times? # this has multiple drawbacks: # - it&#39;s repetitive and makes the code longer # - if we wanted to change the operator being # applied to `leg1` and `leg2`, we&#39;d have to do it twice! leg1_squared = leg1 * leg1 leg2_squared = leg2 * leg2 return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## VERSUS ## # this works, but let&#39;s try to write the &quot;squared&quot; variable assignment statements more concisely... def square(a): return a * a def hypotenuse_abstracted(leg1, leg2): # not only is this shorter, but we can now: # - better understand the code at a glance--we know exactly # what `square` should do # - change the operator in a single place (`square`) rather than # multiple times within this hypotenuse function leg1_squared = square(leg1) leg2_squared = square(leg2) return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## EXTRA CHALLENGE ## # is it possible to write the `hypotenuse` function in a single line? def hypotenuse_abstracted2(leg1, leg2): # ... pass assert hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5 ########DO THIS FOR EC############# . Abstracting Shared Features . Say we want to create a set of functions that count the number of words in a sentence that start with a certain character. We want to create... . count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(sentence) | count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(sentence) | . In order to count words starting with a certain character, we&#39;ll first need to split up the sentence into words. This behavior will be shared across both functions we intend to create, so procedural abstraction is appropriate here. . # is a separate element in the list def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string! Don&#39;t you think this is cool? &quot; a_count = count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s) d_count = count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s) print(&quot;Words starting with a:&quot;, a_count) print(&quot;Words starting with d:&quot;, d_count) . Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 . In the above example, we have: . defined several functions that perform different tasks related to processing a string | abstracted away shared behavior for both functions that count the number of words starting with a specific character in a string | . Topic 3.13 (3.C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Overview: Learning Objectives . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . | . Vocabulary: . Procedure - a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function | Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure | Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function | Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters | . Functions - Basic Structure . Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard&#39;s format, Python, and Javascript. . Collegeboard . Above, the function is defined as PROCEDURE, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with procName, which is simply how the function is identified. parameter1, parameter2,... are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it. block of statements are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as print() in Python. . Python . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where def defines the function, function, and then is followed by parameters a,b, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with function(1,2). The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed. . Javascript . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with function and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example. . Example . function div(a,b) { return (a+b)/2 } div(3,7) . What is the procedure name? | What are the parameters? | What operation is being done? | what would the output of this code be? | . Parameters . In functions, there are sometimes parameters that the functions have in which you can call to the function giving arguements that will provide input to the function For example: | . def function(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(&quot;num1 is greater than num2&quot;) elif num1 &lt;num2: print(&quot;num1 is less than num 2&quot;) num1= 6 num2 = 8 function(num1,num2) . num1 is less than num 2 . In this function, it takes in two parameters num1 and num2 | Whithin this function it uses conditionals to determine if num 1 is larger or smaller than num2 | When calling to this function we must put in two arguements, num1 and num2 respectively | We put in 6 for num1 and 8 for num2 and the algorithm runs and gives us an outcome | . This basic function in python can be recreated in Javasript . function compare(a,b) { if(a&gt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;) } else if (a&lt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is less than b&quot;) } } // How do you call to this function? . what are the parameters? | What is the output? | what are the arguements? | . Calling functions . When calling functions, you have to ask yourself some questions Does the function have any parameters? | does the parameter have output? | . | Depending on these answers, the way you will call to a function will be different | . Example where it does does have parameters and gives output . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = 0 Feet = inches / 12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2 . If you look closely, there is a return at the end of the function, this returns a value when you call the function | This is why we have to set a variable, in this case result equal to the output of the function. | Also one thing to notice is that this function also takes in a parameter called inches | . Here&#39;s an example of calling functions in HTML with Javascript: . HI . . &lt;!-- function is called here --&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;enter&quot; onclick=&quot;print(a,b)&quot;&gt;HI&lt;/button&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- javascript --&gt; &lt;script&gt; function print(a,b) { document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;).innerHTML = a + b // math } // variables are defined var a = 1 var b = 2 &lt;/script&gt; .

Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow!

Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | .

Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow!

When creating an algorithm, its good to outline its process before coding This ensures that it is sequenced correctly | . | You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm | This may allow for the coding process to be more efficient and effective | . | . Review of Selection and Iteration . Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example 1 . Start | The number of pretzels in the pack is 6 | Eat one pretzels, number of pretzels in pack goes down by 1 | How many pretzels are left? | Repeat step 3 until number of pretzels is 0 | Display that pack is empty | Finish | pretzel = 6 while (pretzel &gt; 0): pretzel -= 1 print(pretzel) if pretzel == 0: print(&quot;All done!&quot;) . 5 4 3 2 1 0 All done! .

The defention of a Boolean is a denoting a system of algebraic notation used to represent logical propositions, especially in computing and electronics. | A boolean expresions are either true or false. | Testing if two numbers or variables are equal is a common example. | For example: The sky is blue = True | What do we use to represent them? (Hint think of how domain/range of graph is answered) &lt;- variables | How is binary related to this? &lt;- 0=false and 1=true | How could this be used when asked a question? | . Examples (Not part of homework) . Type the code down below for these two example . Try to make a statement that determines if a variable &quot;score&quot; is equal to the number 3 | Try to make this score variable have an output if it equals 3 | . # The code for ex:1 score = 3 i = score if i == 3: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) # The code for ex:2 . True . Relational Operators . The mathmatical relationship between two variables | Determines an output on whether or not the statement is true | a=b, a&gt;b, etc. | . Examples (Not part of homework) . Type the code down below for these two example . You have to be the age of 16 or older to drive | Each rollercoaster cart holds 4 for people per cart | . # Put the code for ex:1 i = &quot;age&quot; if i &gt;= str(16): print(&quot;can drive&quot;) else: print(&quot;cannot drive&quot;) # Put the code for ex:2 i = &quot;number of people&quot; numcarts = i/4 cannotride = 16 % i . Logical Operators . NOT . NOT, it displays the opposite of whatever the data is. Mainly used for true/false, and does not effect the variable. | . isRaining = False result = not(isRaining) print(result) . True . AND . AND, used to evaulte two conditions together and determine if both condintions are met | . grade = 95 if grade &gt; 70 and grade &lt;= 100: print(&quot;You passed the quiz&quot;) .

Explain in your own words what each logical operator does | Code your own scenario that makes sense for each logical operator | . Lesson 3.6 Paaras/Shruthi . Learning Objectives (Some Things You Might Want to Keep Note Of) . Conditionals allow for the expression of algorithms that utilize selection without a programming language. | Writing conditional statements is key to computer science. | Determine the result of conditional statements | . Key Terms . Selection: The specific block of code that will execute depending on the algorithm condition returning true or false. | Algorithm: &quot;A finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task.&quot; | Conditional Statement / If-Statement: A statement that affects the sequence of control by executing certain statements depending on the value of a boolean. | . function isEven(parameter) { if (parameter % 2 == 0) { console.log(&quot;The number is even.&quot;); } else if (parameter % 2 != 0) { console.log(&quot;The number is odd.&quot;) } } isEven(4) . A computer science student such as yourself will see conditional statements in JavaScript a lot. Below is an example of one in action: . if (30 == 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is true&quot;) } . That is one conditional statement, but this algorithm is too simple to have anything done with it. Below is an algorithm building on the previous algorithm: . if (30 == 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is true&quot;) } else if (30 != 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is false&quot;) } . Input In [6] if (30 == 7) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . Conditional statements can be used for many a purpose. The algorithm above was quite simple, but conditionals can be found in more complex algorithms. . Essential Knowledge . Conditional statements (&quot;if&quot; statements) affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression. The exam reference sheet provides: . In which the code in block of statements is executed if the Boolean expression condition evaluates to true; no action is taken if condition evaluates to false . # also needs to iterate through to check every character (what if there are multiple of each vowel?) word=input(&quot;Input a word to check how many vowels it has. &quot;) i == 0 #number of vowels if word.__contains__(&quot;a&quot;): i =+ 1 if word.__contains__(&quot;e&quot;): i =+ 1 if word.__contains__(&quot;i&quot;): i =+ 1 if word.__contains__(&quot;o&quot;): i =+ 1 if word.__contains__(&quot;u&quot;): i =+ 1 if i == 0: print(&quot;this word has no vowels&quot;) else: print(i) .

Guiding questions for a simulation: . - What makes it a simulation? - What are it’s advantages and disadvantages? - In your opinion, would an experiment be better in this situation? . Examples of Simulations: . Simulations are used all the time over many different industries . testing safety of a car | games | testing the efficiency of a parking lot | testing a new train route | . Simulation vs. Experiment . Experiment definition: procedure undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact | . So, why use a simulation? . Advantages: Can be safer | More cost-effective | More efficient | More data in less time | . | Disadvantages: Not as accurate as experiments | outside factors not included (ex: in rolling dice simulation gravity and air resistance) | . | When do you not use a simulation? when a situation already has set results/data (won&#39;t change) | examples: a score in a game, most purchased food, average yearly wage | . | . leads into real life game example: . . . A Real Life Example: Four Corners - Lydia &amp; Ava . an example of a simulation and experiment = the game of 4 corners | games are simulations! | We are going to play a round of 4 corners here in class. This game is a real life version of our simulation. | Mr. Mortensen will be the person in the middle choosing corners. | Everyone will choose a corner, and if your corner is chosen, you are out! | . | . The rules of the game: . a person stands in the center of a room and the 4 coners are labeled 1-4 | Every player chooses a corner while the person in the middle closes their eyes | person in the middle chooses/calls out a number when instructed | every player in the chosen corner is now out | contine until there is a winner! | Let&#39;s play! . Below is the simulation of the four corners game! . import random status = &quot;in&quot; while status != &quot;out&quot;: chooseCorner = input(&quot;What corner do you choose?&quot;) corner = random.randint(1,4) if int(chooseCorner) == corner: status = &quot;out&quot; print(&quot;You chose corner number &quot; + chooseCorner + &quot; and you&#39;re OUT&quot;) else: print(&quot;You chose corner number &quot; + chooseCorner + &quot; and are still in!&quot;) . You chose corner number 2 and are still in! You chose corner number 3 and are still in! You chose corner number 4 and you&#39;re OUT . Comparing Experiment to Simulation Code: . Mr. Mortensen (person in the middle) = random.randint | if statement = if player is out | else = safe/continue | while loop = repeats process until there is a winner of the game | . DEBRIEF QUESTIONS: . Why is it better to code simulations than experiement in real life? | What makes this game a simulation? | What are its advantages and disadvantages? | Would an experiment be better in this situation?

Below is a simulation of the Game of Life, originally written by John Horton Conway. Mr. Mortensen has this game on the APCSP site and we think that it is a great example of an interactive simulation. . What it is . This game is an unpredictable cellular automaton | automaton = simulates and imitates human life, hence why this is called the game of life | After creating the initial configuration, the game evolves without pattern | . How it works . Cells in this game are alive or dead, similar to binary where they are on or off | The user created an initial configuration of cells on the grid, and presses play (tap the squares on the grid) | a cells&#39;s status (alive or dead, on or off) depends on the surrounding 8 cells status (surrounding 8 boxes). Here are the rules: The birth rule= a dead cell (blue box) that is surrounded by at least 3 alive cells (yellow boxes), will become alive | The death rule= an alive cell (yellow) with no or only one surviving cell around it dies (becomes blue) | Cell survival= an alive cell (yellow) with 2 or 3 alive neighboring cells will stay alive | . | . Try it Out! . Use the grid below to create cell figurations, press play, and watch your cells die, live, and move around! . . Remix of Game of Life . start step . . Hack #3 .

The defention of a Boolean is a denoting a system of algebraic notation used to represent logical propositions, especially in computing and electronics. | A boolean expresions are either true or false. | Testing if two numbers or variables are equal is a common example. | For example: The sky is blue = True | What do we use to represent them? (Hint think of how domain/range of graph is answered) &lt;- variables | How is binary related to this? &lt;- 0=false and 1=true | How could this be used when asked a question? | . Examples (Not part of homework) . Type the code down below for these two example . Try to make a statement that determines if a variable &quot;score&quot; is equal to the number 3 | Try to make this score variable have an output if it equals 3 | . # The code for ex:1 i = score if i = 3: print(&quot;True&quot;)_ else: print(False&quot;) # The code for ex:2 .

Explain in your own words what each logical operator does | Code your own scenario that makes sense for each logical operator | . Lesson 3.6 Paaras/Shruthi . Learning Objectives (Some Things You Might Want to Keep Note Of) . Conditionals allow for the expression of algorithms that utilize selection without a programming language. | Writing conditional statements is key to computer science. | Determine the result of conditional statements | . Key Terms . Selection: The specific block of code that will execute depending on the algorithm condition returning true or false. | Algorithm: &quot;A finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task.&quot; | Conditional Statement / If-Statement: A statement that affects the sequence of control by executing certain statements depending on the value of a boolean. | . function isEven(parameter) { if (parameter % 2 == 0) { console.log(&quot;The number is even.&quot;); } else if (parameter % 2 != 0) { console.log(&quot;The number is odd.&quot;) } } isEven(4) . Input In [5] function isEven(parameter) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . A computer science student such as yourself will see conditional statements in JavaScript a lot. Below is an example of one in action: . if (30 == 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is true&quot;) } . That is one conditional statement, but this algorithm is too simple to have anything done with it. Below is an algorithm building on the previous algorithm: . if (30 == 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is true&quot;) } else if (30 != 7) { console.log(&quot;The condition is false&quot;) } . Input In [6] if (30 == 7) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . Conditional statements can be used for many a purpose. The algorithm above was quite simple, but conditionals can be found in more complex algorithms. . Essential Knowledge . Conditional statements (&quot;if&quot; statements) affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression. The exam reference sheet provides: .

How this helps me . These topics are very common in everyday code and in collegeboard. They wil appear on the AP test, either for me to interpret for for me to correct or write. This lesson has helped me to: . recognize when a variable is assigned | recognize when other data types (such as a boolean, integer, string) are present | understand what each data type does and which is best for a situation &lt; showed up on the collegebaord MC | how to assign a variable | how to create/interpret a list . | Data Abstraction . I rememebr first seeing data abstraciton on the college board requirements and not understanding what it meant. I feel that this lesson has helped me to understand and hopefully implement Data Abstraction in my future projects (including AP test.) | . | Managing Complexity . I used to approach code the very inefficient way, where you type everything out multiple times and take forever to accomplish something. Now, I recognize ways to shorten the preocess, and make it easier to keep track of the algorithm. This lesson has helped me to recognize those opportunities. | . | Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration . To be completely honest, I had no idea how to approach algorithms and try to describe them with these words before this lesson. That was pretty bad, especially since I need to create a project that implements all of these aspects for the AP test. Now, I can more confidently describe each of these words and how an algorithm uses them, which will be extremely helpful for the AP test. | . | Mathematical Expressions . I remember struggling with the mathematical expressions on our collegebaord MC. I had to research what MOD did. Despite understanding enough to answer the questions, I still didn&#39;t have a solid understanding. After this lesson, I feel more more confident in the operator and what it does. I think I will remember it much better now as well, which will really come in handy when it shows up on the AP test third trimester. | . | Evaluating Expression that Minipulates Strings . One thing that definintely confused me on the collegeboard MC was manipulating strings. There was a specific question asking how you could result in a certian string, by using these munipulations on two previous strings. After researching, I understood what concat did, and how I could use it. However, my skills and understanding were still very shaky. Now, I feel more confident in my ability to both recognize when these manipulations are used, and to be able to write them. Once again, this will be extremely helpful on the AP exam. | . | .",

The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. . Hailstone numbers . The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture are called Hailstone Numbers. Examples:Input : N = 7 Output : Hailstone Numbers: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 No.&gt; ### Iteration The action or a process of iterating or repeating:such as. : a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result. . Undecidable problems . An undecidable problem is one that should give a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs. . Unsolvable problems . An unsolvable problem is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution. . Additional information . A problem posed by L. Collatz in 1937, also called the 3x+1 mapping, 3n+1 problem, Hasse&#39;s algorithm, Kakutani&#39;s problem, Syracuse algorithm, Syracuse problem, Thwaites conjecture, and Ulam&#39;s problem (Lagarias 1985). Thwaites (1996) has offered a £1000 reward for resolving the conjecture. Let a_0 be an integer. Then one form of Collatz problem asks if iterating . always returns to 1 for positive a_0. (If negative numbers are included, there are four known cycles (excluding the trivial 0 cycle): (4, 2, 1), (-2, -1), (-5, -14, -7, -20, -10), and (-17, -50, -25, -74, -37, -110, -55, -164, -82, -41, -122, -61, -182, -91, -272, -136, -68, -34).) . The members of the sequence produced by the Collatz are sometimes known as hailstone numbers. Conway proved that the original Collatz problem has no nontrivial cycles of length &lt;400. Lagarias (1985) showed that there are no nontrivial cycles with length &lt;275000. Conway (1972) also proved that Collatz-type problems can be formally undecidable. Kurtz and Simon (2007) proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable; unfortunately, this proof cannot be applied to the original Collatz problem. . The Collatz algorithm has been tested and found to always reach 1 for all numbers &lt;=19·2^(58) approx 5.48×10^(18) (Oliveira e Silva 2008), improving the earlier results of 10^(15) (Vardi 1991, p. 129) and 5.6×10^(13) (Leavens and Vermeulen 1992). Because of the difficulty in solving this problem, Erdős commented that &quot;mathematics is not yet ready for such problems&quot; (Lagarias 1985). . The numbers of steps required for the algorithm to reach 1 for a_0=1, 2, ... are 0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 16, 3, 19, 6, 14, 9, 9, 17, 17, 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, ... (OEIS A006577; illustrated above). Of these, the numbers of tripling steps are 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, ... (OEIS A006667), and the number of halving steps are 0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 3, 13, ... (OEIS A006666). The smallest starting values of a_0 that yields a Collatz sequence containing n=1, 2, ... are 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 3, 9, 3, 7, 12, 7, 9, 15, 3, 7, 18, 19, ... (OEIS A070167). . The Collatz problem can be implemented as an 8-register machine (Wolfram 2002, p. 100), quasi-cellular automaton (Cloney et al. 1987, Bruschi 2005), or 6-color one-dimensional quasi-cellular automaton with local rules but which wraps first and last digits around (Zeleny). In general, the difficulty in constructing true local-rule cellular automata arises from the necessity of a carry operation when multiplying by 3 which, in the worst case, can extend the entire length of the base-b representation of digits (and thus require propagating information at faster than the CA&#39;s speed of light). . More information . Hacks/Assignment . Take the two codes above and combine them so one imput gives the output that contains both the hailstone numbers and the number of iterations it takes i = 1. The more efficient the code, the higher your grade will be. (Algorithm Efficency) (.25) . Unit 3, Section 17: Algorithm Efficiency - Kush &amp; Yasha . What is Algorithm Efficiency? . Yasha - Algorithmic efficiency is an aspect of algorithmic programming that measures the number of steps needed to solve a problem. For instance, If I wanted to create a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers the numbers [2,4,5,1,3]from least to greatest, rather than having an algorithm that compares itself to the next number and swaps accordingly it would be more efficient if you had a program that scans through all the numbers and checks whether a number is smaller or bigger than the rest than and sorts accordingly. Both of the algorithms had the same objective, but one runs more efficiently than the other. . Here is an example of an inefficient algorithm: . def inefficientWay(numbers): # Then it loops over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # Now it finds the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # Then it swaps the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(inefficientWay([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - This algorithm is inefficent because it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. This is an inefficient way to sort a list. . Kush - Here is an efficent way to sort a list: . def efficient_sort(numbers): # loop over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # swap the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(efficient_sort([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - The difference in this algorithm is that it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. . How can you use algorithms to better your life: Mini activity . Yasha - Just for a second, think about all the tasks in your life that would work so much better automated. The sky&#39;s the limit. For an activity, write down or take a mental note of a task that you encounter in your day to day life, and think of ways where you can automate that task. An example of this would be me creating an algorithm for my morning routine. . tasks = [&quot;wake up&quot;, &quot;eat breakfast&quot;, &quot;brush teeth&quot;, &quot;go to school&quot;] def complete_tasks(tasks): for task in tasks: # code to complete each task goes here if task == &quot;wake up&quot;: print(&quot;Waking up now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;eat breakfast&quot;: print(&quot;Eating breakfast now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;go to school&quot;: print(&quot;Going to school now!&quot;) # and so on for each task in the list # call the function to complete the tasks complete_tasks(tasks) . Waking up now! Eating breakfast now! Going to school now! . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P1 . Kush - Sometimes when a problem has too many possibilities, a heuristic approach would be taken. let&#39;s use planes as an example. Imagine you were a musician on tour. You have shows in New Zealand, United States, Canada, and Russia. Well, what would be the shortest flight route so you can arrive at those destinations as fast as possible? You start in the United States. . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P2 . Kush - Well, since there are multiple possibilities, I chose to pick the countries closest to each other. The reason I chose this algorithm in particular is that it made the most sense. I had to start at United States, but then I went on to Canada, Russia, New Zealand, and then back to the United States. . Visual Representation . Hacks/assignment .

Express an algorithm that uses iteration without using a programming language | Define an iteration | The Basics Of Iteration | Examples | LESSON Vocab: . Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | Before we dive deeper, we need to understand that an iteration is a part of an algorithm. And in that iteration is a set of instructions that need to be followed until a certain desired output is met. . Examples . Here is an example using online shopping: . Lets say you are looking for a lost item inside of your house... What steps would you take? . Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): #Try changing the 5 and see what happens! print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 4): #Try Changing the 3 and see what happens! break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(11): print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . for i in range(1,11): print(i) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): print(i) . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=1 while i&lt;=10: print(i) i=i+1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 10: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .

            "content": "Unit 3, Section 1.1: Data Types and Variables - Ederick . Essential Knowledge (College Board&#39;s Must Knows): . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). | Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables | Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) | One form of a value is better suited for representation than antoher. | . What is a Variable? . A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. . Variables can be seen as &quot;containers&quot; and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold. In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of &quot;Alex.&quot; How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code? . x = &quot;alex&quot; print(x) . Choosing Variables . When choosing variables, it is important to assign the variables name to something that correlates with what the function of the variable is supposed to do. For example, we do not want a variable that is supposed to hold a name be named &quot;age&quot; becaue it can be confusing and mistakes may be more prevalent. . Example: . age = &quot;25&quot; name = &quot;Timmy&quot; print(name + &quot; is &quot; + age) . car = &quot;Tesla&quot; yearmake = &quot;2020&quot; ownerage = 16 haslicense = True print(&quot;My car is a &quot; + car + &quot; made in &quot; + yearmake) print(&quot;age: &quot; + str(ownerage)) if haslicense == True: print(&quot;can drive&quot;) else: print(&quot;cannot drive&quot;) . Notice how age is going to be seen when printing the code. That can lead to confusion | . Data Types . Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: . integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) | . These types of data types can be useful when trying to represent a value. For example, you would not want a variable meant to represent someone&#39;s name with an integer. . Questions (College Board&#39;s Essential Knowledge): . What exactly IS a variable? | What is the best data type to represent someone&#39;s dog&#39;s name? | Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values? | What is the best way to represent someone&#39;s phone number? | Bonus (Not required but important to know): .

            "content": "Unit 3, Section 1.1: Data Types and Variables - Ederick . Essential Knowledge (College Board&#39;s Must Knows): . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). | Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables | Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) | One form of a value is better suited for representation than antoher. | . What is a Variable? . A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. . Variables can be seen as &quot;containers&quot; and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold. In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of &quot;Alex.&quot; How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code? . x = &quot;alex&quot; print(x) . Choosing Variables . When choosing variables, it is important to assign the variables name to something that correlates with what the function of the variable is supposed to do. For example, we do not want a variable that is supposed to hold a name be named &quot;age&quot; becaue it can be confusing and mistakes may be more prevalent. . Example: . age = &quot;25&quot; name = &quot;Timmy&quot; print(name + &quot; is &quot; + age) . car = &quot;Tesla&quot; yearmake = &quot;2020&quot; ownerage = 16 haslicense = True print(&quot;My car is a &quot; + car + &quot; made in &quot; + yearmake) print(&quot;age: &quot; + str(ownerage)) if haslicense == True: print(&quot;can drive&quot;) else: print(&quot;cannot drive&quot;) . Notice how age is going to be seen when printing the code. That can lead to confusion | . Data Types . Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: . integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) | . These types of data types can be useful when trying to represent a value. For example, you would not want a variable meant to represent someone&#39;s name with an integer. . Questions (College Board&#39;s Essential Knowledge): . What exactly IS a variable? | What is the best data type to represent someone&#39;s dog&#39;s name? | Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values? | What is the best way to represent someone&#39;s phone number? | Bonus (Not required but important to know): . How can we update a variable&#39;s value | What function is used to recieve a user&#39;s input? | Variables (3.1.2) - Noor . Learning objective for 3.1.2: . Determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment . done through looking at how we can use the assignment operator | . Note: . Collegeboard uses &lt;-- as the assignment operator . The assignment operator looks different for different types of coding languages A variable will take the most recent value assigned | . How do you even store a value inside a variable? . Let&#39;s use python for our example: . In python, the assignment operator is the equal sign (=) | In order to store a value inside a variable, we must: Give the variable a name | place the assignment operator | input the variable value | . | . highscore = 100 # How do you store a number like 3.72? money = 3.72 # What about storing your username (string)? username = &quot;name&quot; # What if it is raining outside and you want to store that fact (boolean)? is_raining = True # What about a list of groceries? groceries = [&quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;flour&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;] .

            "content": "Lesson 3.3 . Luka . Lesson 3.3.1 . What is the goal? . Express an algorithm that uses sequencing without using programming language. | . What is an algorithms? . An algorithm is a finite set of instruction that accomplish a task, it can be expressed by natural language, diagrams, and various other ways. | . What are the three parts of an algorithm? . Sequencing, selection, and iteration. . | Every algorithm can be created by a mixture of sequencing, selection, and iteration . | . What is a sequence? . A sequence is the order of how to do something to achieve a result, similarly to how you follow the instructions from a teacher. | . What is a selection? . A selection allows an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met, an example of this is when your car is out of fuel, you go to the gas station to fill your car, but if your car is full you wouldn&#39;t go to the gas station. | . What is a iteration? . An iteration is a loop and doing something again until a condition is met, like you put away your computer when you are finished with your work. | . Hacks . You will describe the different parts of an algorithm, sequencing, selection, and iteration in the image below. | . sequencing: | Selection: | Iteration: | . Saavan . Mathematical Expressions . How do we represent a step-by-step algorithmic process using sequential code statements? . First off what is a sequential code statement? Sequential statements are used in processes to specify how signals are assigned. The process is executed in order as a whole. After all the sequential statements in the process are executed the signals are assigned their new values. They execute in the order in which they appear in the process. | . | Sequencing - First step to do- Second step to do - third step to do Followed in the order that the code comes in. | You can put numerical values within variables. You can also put variable values inside other variables Ex. grade - 82 | Ex. highScore - currentScore | . | Can also store results of operations inside of a variable Ex. name - firstName + lastName | . | Can store results of a procedure call Average - calcAverage (10,20,30) | . | Order of operations very important Ex. grade1 - 10 | Grade 2 - grade 1 | . | . | Example Problem - calculate and display average of 25, 32, 42 Num1 - 25 | Num2 -32 | Num3 - 42 | Average - (num1 + num2 + num3)/3 | DISPLAY (Average) | . | . Antony . Goal: Evaluate expression using arithmetic operator. . Arithmetic operator are language that use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operator. . The order of arithmetic operation is the same with mathematic operation(Subtraction first). . Examples of arithmetic operators: . -Addition: a+b -Subtraction: a-b -Multiplication: a*b -Division: a/b -Modulus: a MOD b (a and b can be string or number) . Examples of arithmetic operator in code: . 10 + 5 * 8 / 4 . 20.0 . (10+5) * 8 / 4 . 30.0 . num1 = 10 num2 = 5 num3 = 7 result = num1 + num2 + num3 print(result) . 22 . Modulus operator divides the given numerator by the denominator to find a result,which is finding the remainder for the division(remainder has to an integer). . Operator with MOD have the same sequence with multiplication and division. In python and most programming languages, the syntax of MOD is % . Examples with use of MOD: . num1 = 12 num2 = 25 num3 = 14 result = num1 / 4 * num3 + 9 % 2 - num3 print(result) . 29.0 . num1 = 12 num2 = 25 num3 = 14 result = num2 % num1 * (num3+6) - 10 print(result) . 10 .

            "content": "Taking the Final . There were many questions where I had to stop and think for a while. However, this final didn’t feel as challenging or overwhelming as the previous practice quizes. . Strategies/improvements . I noticed that many of the questions that were on the final were similar to the ones we had taken earlier after the videos. They felt much easier this time. . I understand the topics much better now | broke up the code into pieces (wasn’t overwhelmed by the whole chunk) | took pieces step by step to understand what the code does | used process of elimination (was able to limit down the options until I felt confident in an answer) | when I was stuck, I’d discuss with my teammates who were taking the test as well (combinded knowlege and backgrounds helped to conclude an answer) | . ### Corrections I got a 48/50 on the final, which would be a 5 on the AP test. These were the problems I got incorrect. . #11 | My mistake was that I thought that the code compares each element to every other element in the list. Originally, I thought since the list is checking for duplicates, it would need to check for dupliactes in all the elements. | However, it acutually only compares it to the elements that follow, since it iterates through j + 1. It doesn’t require checking the previous ones since it checks for duplicates as it goes. . | #36 | This question was very hard for me to understand, even after seeing the correct answer. I asked a couple people for help, and their explanations aided in my current understanding. | At first, I thought that i &lt;- i + 1 needed to be first in order to make it even before multiplying it by 2 everytime. I misunderstood the parts of the code, and mixed up appending it to the list and iterating through it. | The APPEND(evenlist, 2 * i) needs to be first. It appends an empty list, and then multiplies i (with a current value of 1) by 2 in order to make it even. It then iterates through by adding one to i. | . Night at the Museum . The Night at the Museum process was a little chaotic for my group. Just before we had to leave to head to the school, our code was changed and made a major error. Our AWS wouldn’t deploy, so we couldn’t fetch data from our APIs. However, it was still a successful night with many intresting projects | it was so intresting to go around and see all the projects that other students created.

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend.

Python code that support Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD): https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio/blob/main/model_jokes.py | . | . Hacks . Find and use an API as part of your project. An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

Collaboration is essential in everyday life | Facebook (very successful tech company) says “Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.” | To create the new and improved Super Mario Brothers, 2 partners listened to each other and used eachother’s ideas to create an even better version | interpersonal skills learned through collaboration: communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, negotiation | . How to Collborate in APCSP . Pair programming (2 programmers): “the driver” writes program code while “the observer/pointer/navigator” reviews each line of program code as it is typed in | Think-Pair-Share: students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, then share results with the class | Leave comments in your code: communicate to your partner(s), communicate to yourself, acknowleedge code segments/media from other sources, differentiate what you and partner(s) did, clarify the functionality of your code | .

            "content": "Planning Stage . This stage really helped me to stay organized. Also, I can measure my progress since I started this project. . Questions . Which Carlson twin is better? (put image of Ava and Alexa as buttons) | What is the Carlson twins’ favorite hobby? (put image of us in cheer and 3 other hobbies as buttons) | What is the Carlson twins’ favorite Spider-Man? (put images of the 3 spidermans as buttons) | How swaggy are the Carlson twins? (put an image of twins looking cool and use sliders?) Outline . | 6 total screens | opening screen | 4 questions each on a screen | closing screen w score Need to: . | figure out a way to click the wrong answer (more screens?) | how to add images (and as buttons) | be creative (a way to click on pic to show answer?) | . . My finished quiz! . What Worked . Creating this quiz with code.org made it much easier. I slowly got the hang of it, as I understood and learned how each function, variable, and control worked. App Lab made it very easy to add images, as well as buttons and texts. Then, i followed the very similar format for each “onevent”. . Challenges/What Didn’t Work . This project involved a lot of trial and error. I would try see some examples or try and understand what a function would do, and then I’d change it a bit and see what would happen. This happened many times, leading to new thinds but also errors. It took me a lot of time and trials to figure out how to incorporate an if/else statement. The order and location in which the functions are is essential. That is another thing I learned through trial and error. However, there were occasions where I could not figure out how to make it work. In that case, I would strategize a new way of doing. For example, at the end of my quiz where the messages with your end score come up, I had to use “while” statements and define the score as a number. At first, I used inequalities, but they only worked for some situations. I decided to make it simpler, and only use “===”, rather than “&lt;= or &gt;=”. ADAPT AND OVERCOME . Performance Task Skills . Program Purpose and Funcion . This program’s purpose is to test people’s knowledge on the Carlson Twins. Another goal is to tech those who don’t know us well, and achieve a feeling of a closer relationship. | Javascript is used in this program to navigate through different screens, texts, and buttons (outputs) as a user enters data (clicking buttons, type in answers, sliding bars). | . Data Abstraction . In this project, we were given a tool, Code.org, to help simplify the process of using Javascript to make a quiz. It did not involve any lists or other data collection types. This quiz is simple, therefore not needing a data list or dictionary. | . Managing Complexity . In order to be more efficient, the next time I make a quiz using this program, I will attempt to define a function. Then, I will use that function and create a list with the inputs. Hopefully that would be more efficient and speed up the process of coding. | . Procedural Abstraction . As i said in managing complexity, I did not define any new funtions (that weren’t already options provided by code.org). However, I did learn some of the basics of Javascript through exploration and the creation of this quiz. | . Algorithim Implementation . I used sequencing and selection in this quiz. All of the events are in a specific order, going in order of the cells. It is not iteration since I am not using any lists or dictionaries. Selection is used in this quiz with the score calculations, and the incorrect page. Everytime the user gets the correct answer, +1 is added to the variable “score”. These aren’t neccesarily in order, making it selection. | . Testing . Every step of creating this quiz involved testing. Whenever I added a new button, image, or even changed the inequality on the score, I tested it. Also, if there were many options (like getting 2/3 vs 3/3 correct), I would test every possible outcome. Through this process of trial and error, I was able to achieve a successful quiz. | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .

Python and API resource definitions are used for RESTful API definitions. Abstraction of Frontend and Backend code, the exchange of standard data format (JSON), and guidelines for exchange (REST) is a technique that saves a lot of time between developers. Learning APIs is a highly recommended step for every developer trying to break into the world of tech. . Covid19: RapidAPI example. This is introducing APIs by accessing something that already exists. RapidAPI shows how many practice RESTful definitions. Almost any data source imagined can be accessed here. | Jokes: An introduction to Python RESTful API libraries. A Python List is used to make a Data Model, but persistence in this technique is limited, each time server is refreshed data is lost. This example is great for learning, but data is considered volatile. | Users: Another RESTful API library example. However, this backend establishes data persistence through the use of a database. This data if properly managed in deployment and migrated when changed can last forever. | . Web API Overview . . A Web API is an application programming interface typically for a web browser. Non-changing or Static Endpoints are used in interacting with the server-side Web APIs. RESTful Web APIs use HTTP methods to access resources via URL parameters, and use JSON for transmitting text between client and server. Server. In these examples, we will be using Python to define REST APIs. Python tools are very popular for building RESTful APIs | REST: Representational State Transfer. A set of guidelines on how to architect a network-connected software system. | Client-server: One guideline is a client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently. | Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or using authentication. This will be clarified by application and security requirements. | . Client. JavaScript is the frontend language used to consume data from the Python defined REST APIs. Fetch will be used to make HTTP requests, as well as handle HTTP response. There are four basic HTTP methods, they align with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). | GET =&gt; Retrieve/Read data | POST =&gt; Create data | PUT =&gt; Update data | DELETE =&gt; Delete data | . REST endpoints will have similarity from application to application. In planning APIs, for a Users system you can anticipate key methods. The Users RESTful APIs would likely contain these endpoints. | GET: /users =&gt; Get a list of users | GET: /users(id) =&gt; Get a single user | POST: /users =&gt; Create a new user | PUT: /users(id) =&gt; Update a user | DELETE: /users(id) =&gt; Delete a user | . Once a RESTful API receives and processes an HTTP request, it will return an HTTP response. Included in this response is an HTTP status code. Common status codes are shown. | 200 =&gt; OK, this response will then have the promise of JSON data | 400 =&gt; Bad Request | 404 =&gt; Not Found | 500 =&gt; Internal Server Error (aka bug) | . . . .",
