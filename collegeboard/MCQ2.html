<ul>
  <li>I feel that this quiz was <u>much easier</u> than the final last trimester. I have improved so much with both performance and being mentally prepared (more confidence). I have learned a lot this trimester and have become so much more familiar with the code in these MCQ questions.</li>

<ul>
  <li>test taking strategies</li>
  <li>more familar with code</li>
  <li>can take code step by step (not freak out when I see it all)</li>
  <li>more familiar with many of the functions/code that are in the MCQ from this trimester</li>
  <li>I was able to take this test much more quickly and with less stress/uncertainty as the final from last trimester :)</li>

<p><img src="/Alexa-Fastpage/images/Q13.jpg" alt="Q13"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Question 13:
    <ul>
      <li>This question stumped me a little. To me, all three options seem like they would work and are reasonable. However, I think in order for the expressions to evaluate to false, there needs to be a “NOT” included. That would be why option 1 doesn’t fit the critera.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/Alexa-Fastpage/images/Q22.jpg" alt="Q22"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Question 22:
    <ul>
      <li>I believe that I read this question incorrectly and needed to read it slower so that I could get every detail. On algorithm A, I read “student adds his or her height to the value on the card” and thought it meant that they only write their height on the card (rather than adding their height to the previous height). I can now see why both of these algorithms would calculate the correct average.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/Alexa-Fastpage/images/Q24.jpg" alt="Q24"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Question 24:
    <ul>
      <li>This question definitely worked my brain. I thought that since the innermost block was repeated y times, and that was repeated 3 times, that the answer would be y^3. However, after reading their explanation it makes much more sense now. Since the</li>
      <li>“The value of the variable result is initially set to 0. The outer REPEAT block is executed three times, and the inner REPEAT block is executed y times. Any block inside both of these blocks will be executed 3y (3 multiplied by y) times. Since the innermost block increases the value of the variable result by 1, the final value of the variable result is 3y.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/Alexa-Fastpage/images/Q30.jpg" alt="Q30"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Question 30:
    <ul>
      <li>This question definitely confused me. I think I am starting to understand it though. It gives coordinates of a point on a circle, as well as its radius. It then calls the function “drawCircle(x, y, r)” before subtraction from y and r. Or, it adds to y and r and then calls the function “drawCircle(x, y, r)”. I was confused about when the function should be called. It should be called before subtraction, but after addition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The next time I take an MCQ test, I need to take the questions slightly slower and make sure I understand <u>every</u> detail and what the question is asking.</li>
