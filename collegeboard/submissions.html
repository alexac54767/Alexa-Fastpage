<ul>
  <li>I was surprised to see the score that collegeboard gave this student. Looking through the written response, I believed that the project fit all the critera.</li>
  <li>Row 1 (Program Purpose and Function): The student didn’t get the point for row 1 since they fit 5 of the 6 critera. Collegeboard believes that the student didn’t describe the function’s purpose (rather explained its functionality)
    <ul>
      <li>this was eye-opening, especially since the student response seemed alright to me, and like something I would possibly write. Now I realize that I need to be much more careful and detail oriented to ensure I am going to hit all 6 critera</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Row 3 (Managing Complexity): The student also didn’t get the point for row 3 since he met <u>none</u> of the critera.
    <ul>
      <li>This score was shocking to me. This entire class I have seen lists as easier and usually always helpful. When I looked at this project, I believed that the list was very smart and effective. However, apparently it doesn’t contribute to managing complexity. This was also a good warning to me that I need to make sure that my list is actually helping to manage complexity (not all lists are useful)</li>

<ul>
  <li>Row 5 (Algorithm Implentation): I scored differently than college board on one the the critera here. I thought that the student didn’t describe the code enough that one would be able to re-create it. However, that probably just reflects my current abilities in coding (especically compared to an expert working for collegeboard.)</li>
  <li>I believe that this student did a wonderful job. I really love how they put text boxes within the images of code to describe it as they went. It made it much more organized and easier to follow.</li>
  <li>The student was also very thorough with all their explanations. It’s good to keep in mind that quality really matters here (have more than you need)</li>

  <li>Row 1 (Program Purpose and Function): Both Collogeboard and I gave a 0 for this section.
    <ul>
      <li>The student incorrectly identifies the input and output, and descrived the functionality as the purpose. Thier given purpose was incorrect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Row 2 (Data Abstraction): The student recieved a 0 on this section from Collegeboard, but I gave it a 1.
    <ul>
      <li>They did have images of lists and identified a name, however, the name did not correleate to the images provided.</li>
      <li>When I do my project, I need to make sure I spend careful attention to details, and make sure every description matches my images.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Row 3 (Managing Complexity): Both Collogeboard and I gave a 0 for this section.
    <ul>
      <li>The images did not show a list being used, and the code was not complex.</li>
      <li>the sudent did not explain how the list manages complexity</li>
      <li>I need to make sure that my project will have a list that actually manges complexity and is useful</li>

  <li>Row 4 (Procedural Abstraction): The student recieved a 0 on this section from Collegeboard, but I gave it a 1.
    <ul>
      <li>the response does not describe how this procedure contributes to the overall functionality</li>

  </li>
  <li>Row 5 (Algorithm Implentation): Both Collogeboard and I gave a 0 for this section.
    <ul>
      <li>the description of the program was brief and doesn’t allow for someone to recreate it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What I’ve learned with this project and scoring is that I will need to follow the directions completely when I do my project.</li>

      <li>the two calls are not specific, and are from the procedure (not to the procedure)</li>
      <li>the conditions provided aren’t actully being tested, but instead are operations done by the user</li>
      <li>student didn’t provide what the acutal results would be with the calls, only what would appear on the screen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I have learned a lot from this example. I need to b e very specific ith my descriptions, but I also have to be careful that they are correct. I need to understand my code completely to ensure that I am answering every question thoroughly and correctly.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Collegeboard and I both gave this student a 5/6.</li>
  <li>Row 6 (Testing): Both Collegeboard and I gave scored this section a 0
    <ul>
      <li>the student was not specific in the arguments that are passed through the parameters</li>
      <li>the conditions the student provided don’t match the parameters in the program</li>
      <li>described the code rather than the result</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>this student did a great job on their project. Beside not understanding the testing section (make sure to understand exactly what they are asking for), this is a <mark>good example</mark> to reference in the future.</li>
</ul>
