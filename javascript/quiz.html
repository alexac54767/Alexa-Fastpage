<h1 id="what-worked">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-worked" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Worked</h1>
<p>Creating this quiz with code.org made it much easier. I slowly got the hang of it, as I understood and learned how each function, variable, and control worked. App Lab made it very easy to add images, as well as buttons and texts. Then, i followed the very similar format for each “onevent”.</p>

<h1 id="challengeswhat-didnt-work">
<a class="anchor" href="#challengeswhat-didnt-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges/What Didn’t Work</h1>
<p>This project involved a lot of trial and error. I would try see some examples or try and understand what a function would do, and then I’d change it a bit and see what would happen. This happened many times, leading to new thinds but also errors. It took me a lot of time and trials to figure out how to incorporate an if/else statement. The order and location in which the functions are is essential. That is another thing I learned through trial and error. However, there were occasions where I could not figure out how to make it work. In that case, I would strategize a new way of doing. For example, at the end of my quiz where the messages with your end score come up, I had to use “while” statements and define the score as a number. At first, I used inequalities, but they only worked for some situations. I decided to make it simpler, and only use “===”, rather than “&lt;= or &gt;=”. ADAPT AND OVERCOME</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#performance-task-skills" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Performance Task Skills</h1>

<h2 id="program-purpose-and-funcion">
<a class="anchor" href="#program-purpose-and-funcion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Program Purpose and Funcion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This program’s purpose is to test people’s knowledge on the Carlson Twins. Another goal is to tech those who don’t know us well, and achieve a feeling of a closer relationship.</li>
  <li>Javascript is used in this program to navigate through different screens, texts, and buttons (outputs) as a user enters data (clicking buttons, type in answers, sliding bars).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#data-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Abstraction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In this project, we were given a tool, Code.org, to help simplify the process of using Javascript to make a quiz. It did not involve any lists or other data collection types. This quiz is simple, therefore not needing a data list or dictionary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="managing-complexity">
<a class="anchor" href="#managing-complexity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Managing Complexity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In order to be more efficient, the next time I make a quiz using this program, I will attempt to define a function. Then, I will use that function and create a list with the inputs. Hopefully that would be more efficient and speed up the process of coding.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="procedural-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#procedural-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Procedural Abstraction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As i said in managing complexity, I did not define any new funtions (that weren’t already options provided by code.org). However, I did learn some of the basics of Javascript through exploration and the creation of this quiz.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="algorithim-implementation">
<a class="anchor" href="#algorithim-implementation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithim Implementation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I used sequencing and selection in this quiz. All of the events are in a specific order, going in order of the cells. It is not iteration since I am not using any lists or dictionaries. Selection is used in this quiz with the score calculations, and the incorrect page. Everytime the user gets the correct answer, +1 is added to the variable “score”. These aren’t neccesarily in order, making it selection.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing">
<a class="anchor" href="#testing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Every step of creating this quiz involved testing. Whenever I added a new button, image, or even changed the inequality on the score, I tested it. Also, if there were many options (like getting 2/3 vs 3/3 correct), I would test every possible outcome. Through this process of trial and error, I was able to achieve a successful quiz.</li>
</ul>
